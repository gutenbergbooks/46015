<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">You</span> must forgive
us.&nbsp; We are barbarians. . . .&nbsp; We are ruffians of the
sun . . . and we must be forgiven everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is easy to forgive in the sun,&rdquo; Domini
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, it is impossible to be anything but lenient in
the sun.&nbsp; That is my experience. . . .&nbsp; But, as I was
saying, the sun teaches one a lesson of charity.&nbsp; When I
first came to live in Africa in the midst of the
sand-rascals&mdash;eh, Madame, I suppose as a priest I ought to
have been shocked by their goings-on.&nbsp; And, indeed I tried
to be, I conscientiously did my best, but it was no good.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t be shocked.&nbsp; The sunshine drove it all out of
me.&nbsp; I could only say, &lsquo;It is not for me to question
le bon Dieu, and le bon Dieu has created these people and set
them here in the sand to behave as they do.&nbsp; What is my
business?&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t convert them.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
change their morals&mdash;I must just be a friend to them, cheer
them up in their sorrows, give them a bit if they&rsquo;re
starving, doctor them a little&mdash;I&rsquo;m a first-rate hand
at making an Arab take a pill or a powder&mdash;when they are
ill, and I make them at home with the white
marabout.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what the sun has taught me,
and every sand-rascal and sand-rascal&rsquo;s child in Amara is a
friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are fond of the Arabs, then?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am, Madame.&nbsp; I can speak their
language, and I&rsquo;m as much at home in their tents, and more,
than I ever should be at the Vatican&mdash;with all respect to
the Holy Father.&rdquo;</p>

vii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> a few writers have essayed to
study the Gypsies in dusty libraries.&nbsp; I have companioned
with them on fell and common, racecourse and fairground, on the
turfy wayside and in the city&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; In my book,
which is a record of actual experiences, I have tried to present
the Gypsies just as I have found them, without minimising their
faults or magnifying their virtues.&nbsp; Most of the Gypsies
mentioned in the following pages have now passed away, and of
those who remain, many have, for obvious reasons, been
renamed.</p>
<p>For the majority of the pictures adorning my book, I owe a
profound debt of gratitude to my friend, Mr. Fred Shaw; also, for
their kind permission to include several pictures in my
&ldquo;Romany Gallery,&rdquo; my cordial thanks are due to Mrs.
Johnson, of Yatton, Rev. H. H. Malleson, Mr. William Ferguson,
Mr. T. J. Lewis, Mr. H. Stimpson, and Mr. F. Wilkinson.</p>
<p>The phonetics contained in this work are based upon a system
invented by my friend, Mr. R. A. Scott Macfie, of the Gypsy Lore
Society, whose innumerable kindnesses I most gratefully
acknowledge.</p>

I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GYPSY COURT&mdash;MY INITIATION INTO
GYPSYDOM</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">TANGLE</span> of sequestered streets
lying around a triple-towered cathedral; red roofs and gables
massed under the ramparts of an ancient castle; a grey Roman arch
lit up every spring-time by the wallflower&rsquo;s mimic gold; an
old-world Bailgate over whose tavern yards drifted the sleepy
music of the minster chimes; a crooked by-lane leading down to a
wide common loved by the winds of heaven&mdash;these were the
surroundings of my childhood&rsquo;s home in that hilltop portion
of Lincoln which has never quite thrown off its medieval
drowsiness.</p>
<p>Not far from my father&rsquo;s doorstep, as you looked towards
the common, lay a narrow court lined with poor tenements, and
terminating in a bare yard bounded by a squat wall.&nbsp; Every
detail of this alley stands out in my memory with the sharpness
of a photograph; the cramped perspective of the place as you
entered it from our lane, the dreary-looking <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>houses with
their mud-floored living-rooms fronting upon the roadway, the
paintless doors and windows, the blackened chimneys showing
rakish against the sky, all combined to make a picture of
dun-coloured misery.&nbsp; There were, it is true, a few
redeeming features gilding the prevailing drabness of the
scene.&nbsp; The entrance to the court had a southerly outlook
upon green fields stretching up to the verge of the Castle
Dyking, or, to revive its more gruesome name,
&ldquo;Hangman&rsquo;s Ditch,&rdquo; so called from the grim
associations of a bygone day.&nbsp; From these fields a clean air
blew through the court, rendering it a less unwholesome haunt for
the strange folk who dwelt within its precincts; while not half a
mile distant lay the breezy common, a glorious playground for the
children of Upper Lincoln.</p>
<p>Seeing that this court and its denizens were destined in the
order of things to make a profound impression upon my childish
imagination, I may as well develop the picture rising so vividly
before my mind&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>It was somewhere in the fifties of the last century, a few
years, that is to say, before my entrance into the world, that
several families of dark-featured &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; had
pitched upon the court for their Gypsyry, a proceeding at which
our quiet lane at first shrugged its shoulders, then focussed an
interested gaze upon the intruders and their ways, and finally
lapsed into an indulgent toleration of them.&nbsp; Thus from day
to day throughout my early years, there might have been seen
emerging from the recesses of <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Gypsy Court swarthy men in twos and
threes accompanied by the poacher&rsquo;s useful lurcher;
nut-brown girls with their black hair carelessly caught up in
orange or crimson kerchiefs; wrinkled crones smoking short clays,
as gaily they drove forth in their rickety donkey-carts; buxom
mothers carrying babies slung, Indian fashion, across their
shoulders, and bearing on their arms baskets replete with pegs,
skewers, and small tin-ware of home manufacture.&nbsp; As for
children, troops of the brown imps were generally in evidence,
their eldritch shrieks rending the air between the portals of the
little court and the gate opening upon the common.</p>
<p>No observes could possibly miss the fighting scenes and the
ringing shouts which made the court echo again.&nbsp; A
passionate folk are the Gypsies, a provoking word being at any
time sufficient to call forth a blow.&nbsp; Even as I write these
words, visions of gory fists and faces obtrude themselves through
the mists of past days.</p>
<p>However, the Gypsies were never reported to be otherwise than
polite towards the outsider who ventured into the alley.&nbsp;
Diplomats rather than hooligans were they.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s &rsquo;eave &rsquo;alf a brick at
&rsquo;im,&rdquo; is not the Gypsy&rsquo;s way with a stranger
who happens to stroll into the camp.&nbsp; At the same time I
would not have it imagined that the inhabitants of the squalid
court were of the best black Romany breed; far from it, they were
mostly of diluted blood, else how came they to turn sedentary at
all?&nbsp; For <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>pure Gypsies (or <i>Romanitshelaw</i>, as they call
themselves), the aristocrats of their race, abhor settled life,
preferring to die on the road rather than wither inside four
walls.</p>
<p>On the occasion of a horse fair in the city, our lane would
resound with the clanging of hoofs beyond the ordinary, and in
front of the taverns there was much rattling of whipstocks on the
insides of hard hats, in order to enliven some weedy
&ldquo;screw,&rdquo; and so reward its owner for hours of patient
&ldquo;doctoring&rdquo; in a corner well screened from prying
eyes.&nbsp; Then when the autumnal rains set in, and the leaves
began to flutter down in showers, there would come from afar the
rumbling of Romany &ldquo;homes on wheels,&rdquo; driven
townwards by the oncoming of winter.&nbsp; To me it was always a
saddening sight to watch the travel-stained wanderers hying to
their winter quarters through miry streets heavy with mist and
gloom.&nbsp; <i>Staruben s&icirc; gav</i> (town is a prison), an
ancient vagabond was heard to remark on a like occasion.</p>
<p>A spectacle far more inspiriting was the departure of a Gypsy
cavalcade from the city on a gay spring morning.&nbsp; For into
the dingy purlieus where the travellers had wintered more or less
cheerlessly, stray sunbeams and soft airs had begun to
penetrate.&nbsp; Tidings had reached them that away in the open
something had stirred, or called, or breathed along the furzy
lanes and among the tree boughs, and forthwith every Romany
sojourner within the ash-strewn yards of the city became eager to
resume the <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>free, roving life of the roads.&nbsp; How often have I
longed for the brush of an artist to depict the company of merry
Gypsies&mdash;men, women, and bairns, horses, dogs, and donkeys,
jingling pot-carts and living-wagons bedizened with new paint,
starting from the top of our lane for the open country, just when
the wind-rocked woods were burgeoning and every green
hedge-bottom had a sprinkling of purple violets.</p>
<p>Now until my eleventh year I had seen no more than the mere
outside of Romany life, and I might never have had any Gypsy
experiences to relate but for a trivial blood-spilling, which, as
I look back upon it, may well be called my initiation into
Gypsydom.&nbsp; Indeed, the small incident I am about to mention
had for me a most important result, insomuch as it made me akin
to Gypsies for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>My earliest schools were dames&rsquo; academies&mdash;there
were two of these old-time institutions in our lane.&nbsp;
Approached by a dark passage, the second of these had for its
lecture-hall a large brick-floored room, whose presiding spirit
was a dwarfish lady of sixty-five or more, before whom we sat in
rows at long desks.&nbsp; The school consisted of about a score
of children who were awed into subjection by a threatening rod of
supple ash, half as long again as the tapering stick around which
the scarlet-runners in your kitchen garden love to entwine
themselves.&nbsp; This dread implement of discipline, reared in a
recess near our mistress&rsquo;s desk, would oft descend upon the
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>head of a
chattering boy or girl, and to the tip of that rod my own pate
was no stranger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Among my acquaintances at this school was a Gypsy girl whose
parents dwelt at the sunny end of the aforementioned court.&nbsp;
A year or two my senior, Sibby Smith was a shapely lass, having
soft hazel eyes and a wealth of dark hair crowning an
olive-tinted face.&nbsp; Lissom as whalebone, she had a pretty
way of capering along the lanes with hedgerow berries or leaves
of autumn&rsquo;s painting in her hair, and I, a silent, retiring
boy, would watch her movements with admiring eyes.&nbsp;
Fittingly upon that lithe form sat a garb of tawny-brown, with
here a wisp of red and there a tag of yellow, mingled as on the
wings of a butterfly.&nbsp; The girl had a harum-scarum brother,
Snakey by name and slippery by nature, a little older than
herself, with whom out of school hours she would be off and away
searching the bushes for birds&rsquo; nests, or ransacking the
thickets for nuts; and one day in school I remember how she
pulled out inadvertently with her handkerchief a catapult&mdash;a
Gypsy can bring down a pheasant with the like&mdash;and falling
with a clatter at our teacher&rsquo;s feet, the unholy weapon was
straightway confiscated, whereat Sibby&rsquo;s face grew darker
by a shade, as with her pen-nib she savagely stabbed the desk on
which our copybooks were outspread.&nbsp; A roamer in all the
copses and lanes around our city, and enjoying the freedom of the
camps which tarried for little or for long in the old brickyards
fringing the common, this schoolmate <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>of mine expressed the out-of-door
spirit in her very gait, and as she pirouetted along the
causeway, you caught from her flying figure the smell of wood
smoke and the mossy odour of deep dingles.</p>
<p>In all the world it is hard to find the elusive Gypsy&rsquo;s
compeer.&nbsp; Whimsical as the wind, and brimful of mischief as
an elf of the wilds, Sibby was to me the embodiment of bewitching
mystery.&nbsp; From a hillock by the hedge I have watched her
seize a skittish pony by the mane and, leaping astride its back,
gallop madly along a lane, to return a few moments later,
breathless and dishevelled.&nbsp; This was her frolicsome
mood.</p>
<p>Never very far below the surface of the Gypsy nature lurks a
feeling of disdain, waxing fierce at times towards everything and
everybody outside the Romany world.&nbsp; To this mood the Gypsy
life appears to be the only life worth living, and the Gypsy is
the only real man in the world.&nbsp; All other ways and all
alien folk are suspect.&nbsp; There were times therefore when
Sibby&rsquo;s eyes would pierce me through with arrows of
detestation as though one had hailed from beneath the eaves of a
constabulary.&nbsp; Yet the next day, every shred of this dark
feeling would be flung to the winds, as under a scented may-bush
the girl was romancing merrily or instructing me in the peculiar
whistle giving warning of the approach of Velveteens or a
policeman.</p>
<p>Is there in the whole bag of humanity, I wonder, a nut harder
to crack than the Gypsy?</p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>One
afternoon in turning a corner sharply on my way home from school,
it happened that I ran full tilt into Sibby Smith, and before I
could say &ldquo;Jack Robinson&rdquo; I received such a blow on
the mouth as sent me sprawling all my length on the road.&nbsp;
There was, I suppose, something ludicrous in the sight of a
prostrate boy with his legs in the air; so at least the girl
seemed to think, for immediately she burst into laughter, and her
merriment being ever of an infectious sort, I found myself
laughing too, though inwardly I thought my punishment
unmerited.&nbsp; A moment later, however, as I stood wiping the
blood from my lips, the puzzle was explained.&nbsp; There in the
dust lay a half-eaten, red-cheeked apple which the Gypsy had been
munching when the shock of the collision sent it flying from her
hand; hence the blow that descended upon me so swiftly.&nbsp; Nor
after the lapse of nearly forty years have I forgotten the
forceful stroke that laid me low on that autumn afternoon.</p>
<p>On stormy days, when the loud-lunged gusts made a fanfaronade
in the chimney-stacks at home, it was my delight as a boy to seek
the brow of the grassy escarpment overlooking our common, and at
that time I knew nothing more glorious than a tussle with the
wind roaring over the hilltop.&nbsp; Leaping on the springy turf,
hatless and bare-armed, fighting a make-believe giant of sonorous
voice, what high glee of spirit was mine!</p>
<p>In those days the escarpment boasted a row of windmills,
old-fashioned structures, built partly of <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>timber and
partly of brick and stone, and loud was the whirring of sails
thereabouts in a brisk wind.&nbsp; At the head of a cleft in the
hillside, known as &ldquo;Hobbler&rsquo;s Hole,&rdquo; was a mill
which had fallen into desuetude, and its great sails, shattered
by a tempest, lay in tangled heaps on the thistle-grown plot
around the building.&nbsp; To the tall thistles, tufted with
downy seed, came goldfinches, dainty little fellows, shy as
fairies.&nbsp; Hitherward came also visitors of another kind,
for, as might be expected, the unwritten invitation to such a
harvest of firewood had duly spread to Gypsy Court.&nbsp; More
than once in the twilight Sibby got me to help her in carrying
off fragments of timber, and to a boy with <i>Tiger Tom the
Pirate</i> secreted in the lining of his jacket, these small
adventures were not without a tang of the picaresque.&nbsp; As
time went on, the door in the basement of the mill and most of
the window-frames were dragged piecemeal from their places to
boil Gypsy kettles, but there still remained the massive ladder
giving access to the dusty chambers wherein nestled the strangest
of shadows.&nbsp; Every youngster who came to play in
Hobbler&rsquo;s Hole knew quite well that the mill was
haunted.&nbsp; Readily enough we climbed the worm-eaten ladder in
broad daylight, and scampered about the resounding floors, or sat
at the frameless windows pelting bits of plaster at the jackdaws
flitting to and fro, but to think of invading the mouldering mill
in the dusk hour when hollow and common were visioned away into
shadowy night was another <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>matter.&nbsp; Ah, then the mill took
on an eeriness befitting a very borderland of goblindom.</p>
<p>Picturing the crumbling ruin and the wrinkled declivity
dipping below it towards the common, I recall how Snakey Smith
said one day to me, &ldquo;I likes to sit afore a fire on the
ground.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t feel nothing like so lonesome as
you keeps pushing sticks into the fire and watching &rsquo;em
burn away.&rdquo;&nbsp; The words aptly express a Gypsy&rsquo;s
joy in a fire for its own sake, regardless of utilitarian
considerations.&nbsp; At the moment there may be no kettle
waiting to be boiled, no black stockpot demanding to be slung on
the crooked kettle-prop, yet, for the pure pleasure of the thing,
a Gypsy will light a small pile of dead sticks, and, lounging
near, will gaze wistfully at the spiral of thin, sweet smoke
upcurling between the trees in the lane.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, if &ldquo;you&rsquo;s been a bit
onlucky,&rdquo; or, if your sky is cloudy with sorrow, there is
solace in a fire, as in a folk-tale and in the voice of a
violin.&nbsp; Did not Provost M&lsquo;Cormick, lawyer and lover
of Gypsies, find his Border Tinklers, amid their brown tents and
shaggy &ldquo;cuddies,&rdquo; reciting traditional tales to
banish gloom?&nbsp; &ldquo;Whenever he saw me dull he wad say,
&lsquo;Come on, Mary, and I&rsquo;ll tell ye a fairy tale,&rsquo;
and wi&rsquo; his gestures, girns, and granes, he wadna be lang
till he had us a&rsquo; roarin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Gypsy who resided in a derelict railway carriage on a
Cheshire common, having lost a dear child, refused to be
comforted and even declined to take <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>food.&nbsp; To his old fiddle he
confided his grief, his body swaying to and fro as he drew forth
plaintive airs from the strings.</p>
<p>Wandering one evening in cowslip-time below the decrepit
windmill, I came to a stile in the hedge, and, passing into the
lane, I found Sibby and Snakey heaping dead wood upon a fire on
the margin of the common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed the Gypsy girl, &ldquo;I
know&rsquo;d somebody was a-thinking of me, &rsquo;cos my boots
kept coming unlaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you made me jump, <i>baw</i> (mate), you
did,&rdquo; put in her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;How did you
<i>jin</i> we were <i>akai</i>?&rdquo; (know we were here).</p>
<p>&ldquo;See,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what a pother you are
making.&nbsp; I caught a whiff of your smoke right on top of the
hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that I dropped down beside the fire, and, yielding the
soul to the witchery of red-gold flames dancing against the dark,
it was easy enough to glide into the realm of Faerie.&nbsp;
Sibby, who had been lying at full length before the fire, now
gathered herself into a cross-legged posture, and, lapsing into
meditation, sat twisting a black elf-lock round her
forefinger.&nbsp; A touch of the &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; world
seemed also to have fallen upon Snakey, for he lay in silence
staring into the beyond as though he had sighted fairy faces
peering between the brier sprays; or was it that the knotted
tree-bole leaning from the hedge had begun to make
grimaces?&nbsp; At last the boy awoke with a <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>start.&nbsp;
By his side lay a maiden ash-plant with numerous hearts and rings
neatly cut on its green bark, and, whipping out a knife, he
proceeded to add further touches to his <i>kosht</i>
(stick).&nbsp; This led me to talk of my own achievement of that
day in carving my initials on a beech tree not far from where we
were sitting.&nbsp; Whereat Sibby remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it was only last week that me and mother went in
our cart past Dalton Brook, and we pulled up to look at the old
tree what has <i>dui vastaw</i> (two hands) cut into it by
Orferus Herren, and there they were right enough.&nbsp; It was
his brother Evergreen who broke his neck by tumbling headlong
into a stone-pit, wasn&rsquo;t it, Snakey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For sure it was, <i>pen</i> (sister), and our uncles
Fennix and Euri were well-nigh killed the same way right up agen
Scotland, as I&rsquo;ve heard dad say times and agen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Then followed Snakey&rsquo;s story, which, as well as I
remember, ran (in his own words) something like this&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night my uncles Fennix and Euri was crossing a moor
among the mountains, a long way up into the North Country.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;d been sitting all the day in a <i>kitshima</i>
(tavern) and at last they begins to think it were time to be
marching to their stopping-place, some five miles away across the
moor, a wery nasty country with deep pits and ponds in it.&nbsp;
It was getting dark and the teeny stars were shining above the
mountains.&nbsp; Well, my uncles made off <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>with a deal
of bustle at first along a beaten track, but after going a mile
or two, down comes a fog&mdash;a clear thick &rsquo;un it
was&mdash;and they soon got off the path and were lost.&nbsp; It
looked like &rsquo;em having to <i>besh avr&iacute;</i> (lie out)
all night, as poor Jacob did.&nbsp; Only my uncles didn&rsquo;t
see no silver ladder with angels dancing up and down on it, and
<i>mi d&icirc;ri Duvel</i> (God) sitting atop of it.&nbsp; But
just as they were about dead beat after poddling up and down for
I can&rsquo;t tell you how long, they walked as nigh as nothing
over the edge of a deep pit.&nbsp; It were a narrow shave, for
they only managed to save theirselves by clutching at the bushes
atop of the pit.&nbsp; Then what do you think, <i>baw</i>?&nbsp;
They just turned round, and there afore &rsquo;em stood a
terrible crittur rearing itself up and groaning loud.&nbsp; Their
hearts was in their mouths.&nbsp; They thought their time had
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If that ain&rsquo;t a <i>mulo</i> (ghost), my
name&rsquo;s not Fennix,&rsquo; whispered my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Keka</i>&rsquo; (No); &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the
wery <i>Beng</i> (Devil) hisself,&rsquo; says Euri.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there they stands a-dithering like leaves, till at
last my uncle Fennix pulls hisself together and walks on a yard
or two, staring hard afore him, and weren&rsquo;t Euri glad above
a bit to hear his brother say in his nat&rsquo;ral voice,
&lsquo;Come on, it&rsquo;s nobbut a blessed <i>dunnock</i>
(steer) after all.&rsquo;&nbsp; And with that the crittur kicked
up its heels and galloped away, and by a bit of luck my uncles
stumbled right on to a cartway as led &rsquo;em straight to the
tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Among
Gypsies, when the tale-telling mood is on, story will follow
story, often until drowsiness supervenes; for these folk dearly
love a tale, and are themselves possessed of no small store of
family legends and folk-narratives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, it&rsquo;s your turn, sister.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
have that tale about Old Ruzlam Boz&rsquo;ll&rsquo;s
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without stopping for a moment to think, Sibby began to reel
off what was evidently a well-known and favourite story,
punctuating her sentences by picking from her gown and flinging
at me sundry prickly balls of burdock seed, telling of what
prowlings in the woods!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s donkey&rsquo;s ears (<i>i.e.</i> long years)
since Ruzlam Boz&rsquo;ll&rsquo;s wife had a baby boy
born&rsquo;d in a tent near a spring what bubbled out betwixt two
rocks, and every summer they used to <i>besh</i> (rest) by the
same spring.&nbsp; By and by, when the dear little boy grew big
enough, his mammy sent him every morning to fill the
kettle.&nbsp; But one day he got a surprise.&nbsp; There on the
grass by the spring what should he see but a new silver
shilling.&nbsp; Of course he picked it up and put it into his
pocket, and never said nothing about it when he got back to the
tent.&nbsp; Next morning he found double the money at the
spring-head, and so it went on until his pockets were chinking
full of silver, and for all that he never breathed no word about
his luck.&nbsp; But one day Old Ruzlam heard the boy rattling the
money in his pockets, and forced him to tell where he <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>got it
from.&nbsp; Next morning the daddy went off, laughing to hisself
and thinking of the nice heap of silver he was going to pick up,
but after he had looked up and down and all over, he found just
nothing at all, leastways he saw no money; but as he stood
scratting his head, puzzled-like, there, on one side of the
spring, he saw a dear little teeny old man, and on the other side
a dear little teeny old woman, and, saying never a word, they
stooped down and flung water right into Ruzlam&rsquo;s
eyes.&nbsp; So away he ran home, and there, if he didn&rsquo;t
find his boy had gone cross-eyed.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more, he
never came right agen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, by pleasant steps amid scenes not lacking in glamour, I
advanced little by little in my knowledge of these fascinating
straylings with whom no stranger ever yet found it easy to mingle
as one of themselves.</p>

16</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHARACTERS OF THE COURT&mdash;READING
BORROW</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">FEW</span> miles outside my native
city, there stands on the bank of the Roman Fossdyke a lonely
house known as &ldquo;Drinsey Nook,&rdquo; formerly a tavern with
bowling greens, swings, and skittle alleys, a resort of wagonette
and boating parties out for a frolic in the sunshine.&nbsp; Often
on bygone summer eves have I loitered about the old inn gleaming
white amid its guardian trees, but best of all I loved to see the
beechen boughs drop their fiery leaves upon its mossy roof in the
fading of the year.</p>
<p>To-day, as of yore, the brown-sailed barges, laden with grain
or scented fir-planks, glide lazily past the place, and a
motor-boat will at times go racing by, to the alarm of the
waterhens which had almost come to look on the sleepy canal as
their own.</p>
<p>Does it ever dream of its gay past, I wonder&mdash;this old
forgotten house fronting upon the rush-fringed waterway?</p>
<p>One golden October morning, my father, who had a passion for
boating on our local waters, hired a small sailing craft, and,
the breezes aiding us, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>we were wafted along the Fossdyke as
far as the said riparian house of call.&nbsp; Hour after hour we
wandered in the beech woods stretching behind the inn, resting
now on some protruding snag or fallen bole to watch the squirrels
at play, and again pushing our way breast-high through sheets of
changing bracken to the hazel thickets where the nuts hung in
clusters well within reach of our hooked sticks.</p>
<p>Linked with this ramble in the time of the falling leaves is
an impression I have never forgotten.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look,&rdquo;
said my father, pointing to a decayed stump of a post almost
buried amid dank moss, &ldquo;this is all that remains of Tom
Otter&rsquo;s gibbet-tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; I shuddered as he told
how in other days he had heard the chains clanking in the wind,
and he went on to relate that <i>his</i> father was among the
crowd of citizens who, starting from Lincoln Castle one March
morning in the year 1806, followed the murderer&rsquo;s corpse
until it was hanged in irons on a post thirty feet high on
Saxilby Moor.&nbsp; For several days after the event, the
vicinity of the gibbet resembled a country fair with drinking
booths, ballad singers, Gypsy fiddlers, and fortune-tellers.</p>
<p>The impressions of childhood are enduring; and just as the
smell of the wallflowers after an April shower will revive for
you, dear fellow, the vision of a garden walk under a lichened
wall, and the dainty step of your lady love by your side, so for
me the wild scent of withering bracken in the red <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>autumn glades
prompts my fancy to envisage anew the gruesome scene as depicted
by my father on that October day long gone by.&nbsp; Nor is this
all.</p>
<p>To mention the name of Tom Otter is to call up for me more
than one swarthy inhabitant of Gypsy Court who lived to make old
bones and sit by the fire telling tales and smoking black
tobacco.&nbsp; I have but to close my eyes to behold a procession
of these &ldquo;characters&rdquo; straggling out of the dark
court, their faces and figures lingering for a moment in
memory&rsquo;s beam of light, then passing again into the
shadows.&nbsp; And what strange stories are wrapped up in the
names and lives of some of these folk; quaint comedy, grim
tragedy, riotous passion, tales of love, laughter, and tears.</p>
<p>There was old Tom, nicknamed &ldquo;Tom o&rsquo; the
Gibbet,&rdquo; whose patronymic was <i>Petulengro</i>, which is
Gypsy for Smith.</p>
<p>Each of the great Romany clans, be it known, duplicates its
surname, one form being used before the <i>gawj&ecirc;</i>
(non-Gypsies, aliens); the other form, of cryptic import, is for
the brotherhood of the blood.</p>
<p>Old Tom Petulengro, further known as &ldquo;Sneezing
Tommy,&rdquo; owing to his liking for snuff, carried on a
thriving trade in wooden meat-skewers and pegs, and in his
backyard you might see him with infinite patience cutting up
willow rods or splitting blocks of close-grained elder-wood; and
for years I never used to hear in church the familiar words of
the Psalmist, &ldquo;Our bones lie strewn before the pit, like <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>as when one
heweth wood upon the earth,&rdquo; without seeing that narrow
yard with its shining axe lying midst a litter of chips and
splinters.&nbsp; Elder-wood is still in request for meat-skewers,
and to this day not a few country butchers prefer to use the
Gypsy-made article.&nbsp; Old Tom used to say, with a twinkle in
his eye, that he <i>found</i> nearly all his raw material on his
journeys up and down the countryside.&nbsp; For, as you could not
fail to observe, it was a habit with some of the dwellers in
Gypsy Court to absent themselves periodically with their light
carts and tents.&nbsp; Halcyon days were those for the court
Gypsies.</p>
<p>Let it be remembered that the County Council legend, &ldquo;No
camping allowed,&rdquo; had not yet begun to hit you in the eye
from among the bramble brakes on bits of wayside waste.&nbsp; The
rural constable of that time had not the conveniences his
successor enjoys in the bicycle and the village telephone.&nbsp;
There were farmers who still retained a soft place in their
hearts for the Gypsy, and many a country squire viewed the nomads
of the grassy lanes with a kindly eye.&nbsp; If a carriage-horse
grew restive in passing a roadside fire at twilight, up from the
hedge-bottom sprang an obliging fellow who led the animal safely
along and thereby won a cheery word from the squire or his
lady.&nbsp; Even Velveteens would hob-nob with the jovial campers
on the lord&rsquo;s waste, and, quaffing a dram from their black
bottle, would toss a rabbit into the lap of a Romany mother and
go on his way.&nbsp; <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Here and there of course were
tiresome believers in the hoary policy of harassment and
oppression&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pack, and be out of this forthwith,<br />
D&rsquo;you know you have no business here?<br />
&lsquo;No, we hain&rsquo;t got,&rsquo; said Samuel Smith,<br />
&lsquo;No business to be anywhere.&rsquo;<br />
So wearily they went away,<br />
Yet soon were camped in t&rsquo;other lane,<br />
And soon they laughed as wild and gay,<br />
And soon the kettle boiled again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reverting to Tom Petulengro&rsquo;s sobriquet, I confess it
provoked my curiosity not a little.&nbsp; Tom <i>o&rsquo; the
Gibbet</i>&mdash;what could the strange &ldquo;tag&rdquo;
mean?&nbsp; Time passed, even a few years, and one day its origin
came to light during a talk with Ashena Brown, Tom&rsquo;s
married sister, an elderly Gypsy with a furrowed countenance and
deep-set eyes which flashed with fire as she grew excited in her
talk.&nbsp; I can see her bowed figure and long jetty curls, as
in fancy I again stoop to enter the low-ceiled abode in the smoky
court where I listened to her chatter to the persistent
accompaniment of a donkey&rsquo;s thump, thump, in an adjoining
apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful fond o&rsquo; the County o&rsquo; Nottingham
was my people,&rdquo; said the old lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
know&rsquo;d every stick and stone along the Trentside, and
i&rsquo; the Shirewood (Sherwood), and many&rsquo;s the time
we&rsquo;ve stopped at Five Lane Ends nigh Drinsey Nook.&nbsp;
Why, my poor dear mammy (Lord rest her soul) was once fired at by
a foot-pad as she were coming outen the public upo&rsquo; the
bank there.&nbsp; The <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>man&rsquo;s pistol had nobbut powder
in it, for he only meant to <i>trash</i> (frighten) her into
handing up her <i>lova</i> (money), but she had none about her,
for her last <i>shukora</i> (sixpence) had gone in <i>levina</i>
(ale).&nbsp; And after that, my mammy allus wore a big
<i>diklo</i> (kerchief) round her head for to hide her cheek as
were badly blued by the rascal&rsquo;s powder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and I minds how my daddy used to make teeny
horseshoes, knife handles, and netting needles, outen the bits
o&rsquo; wood he <i>tshin</i>&rsquo;d (cut) off the gibbet post,
and wery good oak it was.&nbsp; Mebbe you&rsquo;s heard o&rsquo;
Tom Otter&rsquo;s post nigh to the woods?&nbsp; Ah, but
p&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;s never been tell&rsquo;d that our Tom was
born&rsquo;d under it?&nbsp; The night my mammy were took bad,
our tents was a&rsquo;most blown to bits.&nbsp; The wind banged
the old irons agen the post all night long, as I&rsquo;ve heard
her say.&nbsp; And when they wanted to name the boy, they
couldn&rsquo;t think of no other name but Tom, for sure as they
tried to get away from it, the name kept coming back
again&mdash;Tom, Tom, Tom&mdash;till it sort o&rsquo; dinned
itself into their heads.&nbsp; So at last my daddy says,
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s call him Tom and done with it,&rsquo; and
i&rsquo; time, folks got a-calling him Tom o&rsquo; the Gibbet,
and it stuck to him, it did.&nbsp; There, now, I must give that
here <i>maila</i> (donkey) a bite o&rsquo; summut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I have not done with Tom Otter.</p>
<p>Here is a story even more &ldquo;creepy&rdquo; than the
last.&nbsp; Ashena is again the speaker.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;
them days I&rsquo;d some delations as did funny things that folks
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>wouldn&rsquo;t never think o&rsquo; doing
nowadays.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d an uncle as used to talk to the
<i>Beng</i> (Devil).&nbsp; If anything went wrong wi&rsquo; a
hoss, he&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;<i>Beng</i>, do this, and
<i>Beng</i>, do that,&rsquo; like we talks to the <i>Duvel</i>
(God) when we says &rsquo;ur prayers.&nbsp; But he weren&rsquo;t
eddicated, you see, he didn&rsquo;t know no better.&nbsp; And
whenever uncle and aunt used to pass by Tom Otter&rsquo;s gibbet,
they&rsquo;d stop and look up at the poor man hanging there, and
they allus <i>wuser</i>&rsquo;d (threw) him a bit o&rsquo;
<i>hawben</i> (food).&nbsp; They couldn&rsquo;t let theirselves
go by wi&rsquo;out doing that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was a baker from Harby, and whenever he
passed by the place he would put a bread loaf on to the pointed
end of a long rod and shove it into that part o&rsquo; the irons
where poor Tom&rsquo;s head was, and sure enough the bread allus
went.&nbsp; The baker got hisself into trouble for doing that, as
I&rsquo;ve heard our old people say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Commenting on a parallel instance, occurring about the year
1779, in which some women were wont to throw up to a gibbeted man
a bunch of tallow candles for him to eat, the Rev. S.
Baring-Gould, in his <i>Book of Folk-Lore</i>, writes:
&ldquo;Obviously the idea was still prevalent that life continued
to exist in the body after execution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the procession of &ldquo;characters&rdquo; issuing from the
dark court, I see two familiar figures, the parents of my Gypsy
schoolmate, who would surely have arrested even a
stranger&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>Partly from age, and partly from the habit of <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>his calling,
Plato Smith the tinman stooped somewhat, yet his legs, which were
long in comparison with his body, carried him over the ground
fast enough.&nbsp; A nearer view of the old man&rsquo;s
countenance revealed certain scars concerning which tales were
told to his credit as a fighter.&nbsp; True, he had on one
occasion been worsted by an adversary, for the bridge of his nose
diverged somewhat from the straight line, a record of a telling
blow.&nbsp; Always alert, Plato looked the picture of spryness
when soap and water had removed all traces of the workshop, and
he had donned a green cutaway coat, a bright yellow neckcloth,
and a felt &ldquo;hat of antique shape,&rdquo; high in the crown
and broad of brim, which was pulled well over his eyes whenever
he went out.&nbsp; It was whispered that none knew better than he
how to whistle a horse out of a field, but in this art I fancy he
had grown rusty of late years.&nbsp; To be sure, his long record
as a poacher had brought him occasional lodgments in the local
house of detention, yet so ingrained was this Gypsy habit that he
could hardly refrain from chalking his gun-barrel and sallying
forth on moonlit nights.</p>
<p>A riverside incident associated with Sibby&rsquo;s father is
as fresh in my memory as if it happened but yesterday.&nbsp; A
stream neither broad nor deep is our homely Witham, crawling
onward through fenny flats to the North Sea.&nbsp; It was here
that I learned on summer days to pull an oar in an old black
coble, and to glide steel-shod over the ice in the Christmas <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>holidays.&nbsp; Along a certain reach of the river, I
was initiated by an elder brother into the mysteries of angling
on those tranquil evenings when the bold perch showed their heads
above water, like the fishes that listened to St. Anthony&rsquo;s
sermon.&nbsp; Now it fell upon a day that my brother and I were
crossing the river by ferry-boat, a few miles outside the city,
our companions being Plato Smith and an ecclesiastic from the
minster-close&mdash;four happy anglers were we.&nbsp; At one end
of the flat-bottomed ferry-boat stood the parson fingering his
rod and whistling a lively tune, when, in midstream, there was a
sudden hitch in the chain, flinging the perspiring ferryman upon
his face, and at the same time precipitating our friend from the
minster-close headlong into the river.&nbsp; Never have I seen a
wild duck, or a white-pate coot, disappear more cleanly from
sight than did our brother of &ldquo;the cloth&rdquo; into the
liquid element.&nbsp; Thanks mainly to Gypsy Plato&rsquo;s
resourcefulness, he was extricated pretty quickly, and we left
him in the care of an innkeeper, in whose parlour at dusk we met
him in borrowed raiment, looking more than usually pallid of
countenance beneath the broad eaves of our kindly host&rsquo;s
old-fashioned Sunday &ldquo;topper&rdquo; padded to fit with a
vivid red handkerchief.</p>
<p>A personality even more striking was Plato&rsquo;s consort,
Abigail, as you saw her sunning herself under the parapet of the
Witham bridge hard by the &ldquo;Three Magpies&rdquo; Inn, her
black eyes blinking as a gust from the river flapped the loose
ends of her <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>gay kerchiefs which she wore three or four deep, meeting
on her bosom in old-time style.&nbsp; Hooked like a
falcon&rsquo;s beak, her nose drooped over her pursed lips
towards a prominent chin, giving her a witchlike mien.&nbsp;
Quadrupled strings of corals encircled her wizened neck, and a
black velvet bodice bedecked with silver buttons, a skirt of bold
check pattern, and a poke-bonnet formed her customary walking
attire.&nbsp; Often, on her homeward way after her daily round
with the basket, have I met her puffing a small black pipe as she
shuffled along our lane.&nbsp; By <i>didakais</i> (half-breeds)
she was certainly feared, and they maintained it was bad luck to
meet her first thing of a morning, and were known to turn back on
seeing her in the street.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her eyes make you feel
that queer&rdquo; was a common saying, and it follows that she
ranked high as a fortune-teller.&nbsp; Seldom a fair passed but
you met her in the noisy throng, chaffing the <i>gawj&ecirc;</i>
(gentiles), or surrounded by a group of village Johnnies and
Mollies eager to have their palms read.&nbsp; What a picture she
made as she stooped to tighten the girths of her shaggy donkey at
whose head stood the wild, dusky Sibby with a spring wind
whisking her black locks about her cheeks, out on the open road
beyond the town, for maid and mother were devoted companions on
many a foray into the villages dotted over Lincoln Heath.</p>
<p>Another conspicuous character of the court was a quaint little
hunchback, a pedlar by trade, whose <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>sad deformity and resentful temper
caused him to become the butt of every street gamin&rsquo;s
joke.&nbsp; He would often be seen in company with Sammy Noble, a
wooden-legged vendor of firewood.&nbsp; The pair, I regret to
say, called too frequently at taverns, and more than once I have
seen them assisted home by kindly policemen, or
&ldquo;peelers,&rdquo; as they were then called, who if
resurrected to-day in their long black coats and chimney-pot
hats, would surely be taken for nothing short of cathedral
dignitaries.</p>
<p>The hero of the Gypsy colony was a tall athletic fellow,
&ldquo;Soldier&rdquo; &rsquo;Plisti (or Supplistia) Boswell, who
also bore the nickname of &ldquo;Jumping Jack,&rdquo; of whom I
give a reminiscence or two here.</p>
<p>One day a country squire was driving a pony chaise along a
lane, and, rounding a corner, he came upon a ring of Gypsies
roasting hedgehogs.&nbsp; Imagine his astonishment to see a
slender lad spring up, and, running a few yards, take a flying
leap clear over the pony&rsquo;s back, a feat so pleasing to the
squire that he called the boy to his side and, presenting him
with a bright crown-piece, offered&mdash;so the tale
runs&mdash;&ldquo;to keep him like a gentleman for
life.&rdquo;&nbsp; In return for which kindness, the Gypsy was
expected to disown his people, a condition which was not jumped
at by Jack.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Plisti&rsquo;s home in Gypsy Court was one day the
scene of a singular incident.&nbsp; A fox closely pursued by the
hounds dashed through the open door of the living-room, where
before the fire lay the Gypsy <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>asleep and snoring.&nbsp; Reynard in
his haste managed to sweep the sleeper&rsquo;s face with his
brush; and mighty was the yell that burst from
&rsquo;Plisti&rsquo;s throat on being thus disturbed, causing the
fox to seek refuge in a hovel hard by, where the dogs fell upon
him.&nbsp; A brother of mine who was in the court at the time
obtained possession of the brush, and the trophy was given a
conspicuous place in our home.</p>
<p>In those days it was no unusual course for the Gypsy lads to
enlist in the Militia, and &rsquo;Plisti looked every inch a
soldier as he marched homeward from the morning&rsquo;s drill on
the common.&nbsp; In play he would level his musket at you, and
laugh like a merry boy, if you caught his spirit and made believe
that you were wounded.&nbsp; If he was proud of his scarlet
jacket, his characteristic Gypsy vanity led him to glory in
shirts of dyes so resplendent that in comparison the vaunted
multi-coloured coat of Joseph would indeed have been thrown into
the shade.</p>
<p>The Gypsy spell cast upon me in childhood was now reinforced
by my discovery of the autobiographical writings of George
Borrow.&nbsp; It was in my teens that I devoured <i>Lavengro</i>
in its original three-volume form.&nbsp; By taper-light in an
attic bedroom at home, or in some hollow on the common where the
battered race-cards whitened the base of the gorse
bushes&mdash;our old common is the annual scene of the
Lincolnshire Handicap&mdash;I thrilled over the boy
Borrow&rsquo;s encounter with the Gypsies in the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>green lane at
Norman Cross.&nbsp; I followed him through the crowded horse-fair
at Norwich, and into the smoky tents pitched upon Mousehold
Heath.&nbsp; But the episode which impressed me most of all was
the fight with the Flaming Tinman.&nbsp; The <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> of that narrative would pursue me even into my
dreams.&nbsp; <i>The Romany Rye</i>, with its vivid picture of
Horncastle Fair, was pleasant enough reading, though not nearly
so fascinating as <i>Lavengro</i>.&nbsp; Little did I think that
the coming days were to bring some of Borrows originals within my
ken.</p>

<p>How far Borrow&rsquo;s Gypsies are portraits of individuals,
and to what extent we are able to identify them, are questions
which have often been asked.&nbsp; Don Jorge would probably have
denied the charge of individual portraiture, yet there is no
doubt that he had definite prototypes in his mind&rsquo;s eye
when penning his narratives.&nbsp; Just as in <i>Guy
Mannering</i>, Sir Walter Scott portrayed an actual Jean Gordon
under the name of Meg Merrilies, so we know that Borrow has given
us his old friend Ambrose Smith under the now famous cognomen of
&ldquo;Jasper Petulengro,&rdquo; a fact made plain by Dr. Knapp
in his monumental work <a name="citation28"></a><a
href="#footnote28" class="citation">[28]</a> familiar to all
Gypsy students.&nbsp; Shortly before his death at Dunbar in
October, 1878, Ambrose Smith and his wife Sanspirela (a Heron
before marriage), together with their family, had been noticed
and befriended by Queen Victoria.&nbsp; To <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>wit: the
following entry in <i>More Leaves from the Journal of a Life in
the Highlands</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>August</i> 26<i>th</i>, 1878.&mdash;At
half-past three started with Beatrice, Leopold, and the Duchess
in the landau, and four, the Duke, Lady Ely, General Ponsonby,
and Mr. Yorke, going in the second carriage, and Lord Haddington
riding all the way.&nbsp; We drove through the west part of
Dunbar, which was very full, and we were literally pelted with
small nosegays, till the carriage was full of them; then for some
distance past the village of Belheven, Knockendale Hill, where
were stationed in their best attire the queen of the gipsies, an
oldish woman [Sanspirela] with a yellow handkerchief on her head,
and a youngish, very dark, and truly gipsy-like woman in velvet
and a red shawl, and another woman.&nbsp; The queen is a thorough
gipsy, with a scarlet cloak and a yellow handkerchief around her
head.&nbsp; Men in red hunting-coats, all very dark, and all
standing on a platform here, bowed and waved their
handkerchiefs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the seventh chapter of <i>The Romany Rye</i>, Borrow tells
how he one day got his dinner &ldquo;entirely off the body of a
squirrel which had been shot the day before by a chal of the name
of Piramus, who, besides being a good shot, was celebrated for
his skill in playing on the fiddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nieces of Piramus Gray, whom I know, have testified to their
uncle&rsquo;s excellence as a marksman, and on the authority of
Sinfai, a daughter of Piramus, <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>I have been told that Ambrose
Smith&rsquo;s praise of her father&rsquo;s fiddling was well
founded.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;About a week ago my people and
myself&rdquo; (the speaker is Ambrose, <i>i.e.</i> Jasper
Petulengro) &ldquo;were encamped on a green by a plantation in
the neighbourhood of a great house.&nbsp; In the evening we were
making merry, the girls dancing, while Piramus was playing on the
fiddle a tune of his own composing, to which he had given his own
name, Piramus of Rome, and which is much celebrated amongst our
people, and from which I have been told one of the grand gorgio
composers who once heard it has taken several hints.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gifted fiddler was at that time only a slim fellow of
twenty-eight summers.&nbsp; Long years afterwards, when Piramus
was a very old man and I a youth of twenty, I remember seeing him
in our Lincolnshire town of Louth, where he was still tapping
with his tinker&rsquo;s hammer and fondling his violin in his
cottage at the River Head.&nbsp; A story which the old man never
tired of telling was that of his brother Jack&rsquo;s
heroism.</p>
<p>Upon a day, many years ago, the children of Piramus were
boating on a river, and, their craft capsizing, all were flung
into the stream.&nbsp; Jack, who happened to be on the bank,
leaped in and saved all but two, the oldest and the youngest, who
were drowned.&nbsp; In his day Piramus had excelled as a fighter,
and certainly the knotty fists of the aged tinman looked as if
they had done service in the bruising line.</p>
<p><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>Two
visitors who loved to cheer the last days of Piramus were his
daughter Sinfai and her husband, Isaac Heron, who have themselves
now passed away.&nbsp; Whenever I think of the tall figure of Old
Isaac, I recall one evening in the summer of 1876, when a camp of
the Herons lay just outside of Lincoln.&nbsp; What appeared to be
a Gypsy trial was in progress, and I remember the inward thrill
on beholding those Herons in a ring, chattering like a flock of
daws.&nbsp; Inside the circle stands a young man, bare-headed,
stripped of coat and vest, and gesticulating wildly.&nbsp; Now he
flings his arms about, and now he thrusts his fingers through his
shaggy black hair.&nbsp; On his brow the sweat stands in
beads.&nbsp; I can hear the name &ldquo;Wilhelmina,&rdquo; as it
comes in a piercing shriek from his lips.&nbsp; The old men and
women are muttering together as calmly they look on.&nbsp; In
that throng were Isaac and Sinfai, along with some of the older
Yorkshire Herons, Golias, Khulai, and others.</p>
<p>In after years I came to know very intimately many members of
the clan Heron, and among them a niece of that weird old hag,
Mrs. Herne (to use Borrow&rsquo;s spelling of the name), who sent
the poisoned cake to Lavengro in Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle.</p>
<p>Having had a romantic interest in the Gypsies aroused in me
thus early, I naturally looked forward to the days when I should
leave home and meet the people of the <i>kawlo rat</i> (black
blood) in other parts of the country.</p>
<h2><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NORTH-COUNTRY GYPSIES</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">TYPICAL</span> colliery village in a
bleak northern county was the scene of my first curacy.&nbsp;
Silhouettes of ugliness were its black pit buildings, dominated
by a mountain of burning refuse exhaling night and day a
poisonous breath which tarnished your brass candlesticks and
rendered noxious the &ldquo;long, unlovely street&rdquo; of the
parish.&nbsp; What in the name of wisdom induced me to pitch my
tent in such a spot, I can scarcely say at this distance of time,
unless perhaps it was a mad desire to rub against something rough
and rude after having been reared in the drowsy atmosphere of
pastoral Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>But if the picture which met my gaze on parochial rounds
possessed no inspiring feature, you may take my word for it that
the setting of the picture was undeniably charming.&nbsp; Close
at hand lay the valley of the Wear, by whose brown and amber
waters, broken by frequent beds of gravel, I used to wander,
trout-rod in hand, or, wading ankle-deep in bluebells, I added to
my store of nature-knowledge by observing the ways of the
wood-folk&mdash;the tawny squirrel on his fir-bough, the
red-polled woodpecker hammering at a <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>decayed elm-branch, or a lank heron
standing stiff as a stake on the margin of a pool.</p>
<p>Across the airy uplands at the back of the village runs a road
which was ever a favourite walk of mine.&nbsp; Away in the
distance, Durham&rsquo;s towers lift their grey stones, and
nearer across the fields, &ldquo;like a roebuck at bay,&rdquo;
rises the castle, which together with the lordship of Brancepeth,
Geoffrey, grandson of the Norman Gilbert de Nevil, received as
dowry with Emma Bulmer, his Saxon bride.&nbsp; Right well I came
to know the weathered walls of Brancepeth Castle, where in fancy
I used to hear the blare of bugle (<i>not the motor-horn</i>),
and to a dreamer it is still a place where &ldquo;the swords
shine and the armour rings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One June day I took the byway over the hills, and as I leaned
upon a gate looking towards the castle, a sound of wheels not far
off was heard on the gritty roadway, and from round the corner a
party of Gypsies hove in sight.&nbsp; There were two or three
carts bearing the name of Watland, with several comely people
aboard, and lagging in the rear came a pair of shaggy colts,
whipped up by a shock-headed lad of fifteen.&nbsp; When I greeted
these wanderers, they drew rein and descended from the carts, and
standing there in the sunshine on the road, they appeared to me
more than anything like a gang of prehistoric folk risen from
some tumulus on the moor; features, garments, horses,
vehicles&mdash;all were tinctured with Mother Earth&rsquo;s reds
and browns picked up from wild heaths, clay-pits, and sandy
lanes.&nbsp; To my mind the <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>sight was an agreeable variation from
the daily procession of miners so black with coal-dust that you
could not for the life of you distinguish Bill from Bob, or Jack
from Jerry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you stopping about here?&rdquo; I asked, after an
exchange of salutations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; come and see us to-night on top o&rsquo; the
moor.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be fixed up by then.&rdquo;&nbsp; Turning
to his wife, the leader of the party said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, doesn&rsquo;t he remind you of that young priest up
yonder by Newcastle, what used to come and take a cup of tea with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something about these Watlands which impressed
me.&nbsp; Although obviously poor, they were
light-hearted&mdash;I had caught the lilt of a song before they
came in sight.&nbsp; A blithesome spirit of acceptance, a
serenity drawn from Nature&rsquo;s bosom was theirs, and I could
imagine them whistling cheerily as they bent their heads to
buffeting storms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take no thought for the morrow,&rdquo; is the
Gypsy&rsquo;s own philosophy.&nbsp; Were real road-folk ever able
to tell you the route of the morrow&rsquo;s itinerary?&nbsp;
Break of day will be time enough to discuss the next stage of the
journey.</p>
<p>Sundown&rsquo;s fires burned redly behind the black pines, as
I found myself on the moor, a wide expanse tracked by little
paths worn by passing feet, a haunt of whin-chats, grasshoppers,
and bright-eyed lizards&mdash;sun-lovers all.</p>
<p>Knowing the whimsicalities of the Gypsy nature, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>I had half
expected to draw a blank after dawdling through the afternoon at
Brancepeth Castle.&nbsp; I wondered whether my luck would be the
same as on a past occasion whereon it happened that down a green
lane I had located a picturesque lot of Gypsies who might almost
have stepped straight out of a Morland canvas, and most anxious I
was to secure a few snapshots, but unfortunately my camera had
been left at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be here all day, I expect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure we shall, my <i>rai</i>, you&rsquo;ll find
us here <i>koliko sawla</i> (to-morrow morning), if you&rsquo;s a
mind to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Preferring to act upon the <i>carpe diem</i> principle, I
returned with my camera as expeditiously as I could, and though
but an hour and a half had elapsed, alas! my birds had
flown.&nbsp; Homewards I trudged, a joy-bereft soul for whom the
world had suddenly grown empty.</p>
<p>This leads me to remark that the Gypsies are far from easy to
photograph.&nbsp; The degree of friendship does not enter into
the problem.&nbsp; I have known strangers to pose readily, while
old friends have doggedly refused to be &ldquo;took.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Once a friend and I had talked one of the reticent Herons into a
willingness to be photographed.&nbsp; Yes, on the morrow he would
be &ldquo;took.&rdquo;&nbsp; But with the morrow his mood had
changed.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, <i>raia</i>, not for a thousand
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remember photographing a Gypsy girl under <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>curious
conditions.&nbsp; Said I, as she sat upon the grass&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll allow me to take a little picture?&nbsp;
Your hair is so pretty, and you have a happy face.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>But, no, my words were wasted.&nbsp; Bad luck followed that
sort of thing, a cousin of hers had died a fortnight after being
&ldquo;took.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there some charm for keeping off bad
luck?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking thoughtful for a moment, she replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, if you&rsquo;ll give me a pair of bootlaces,
you can <i>lel mi mui</i> (take my face) as many times as you
<i>kom</i>&rdquo; (like).</p>
<p>I had a pair of laces, <i>but they were in my boots</i>.&nbsp;
Nothing daunted, however, I went off to a shop in the village
half a mile away, and was soon back again presenting the laces to
the girl with an Oriental salaam.</p>
<p>Then I got my picture.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Reverting to the Watlands, I was not disappointed.&nbsp; There
in a hollow on the moor I found them squatting around their
fires.&nbsp; Wearied by travel, some of the elders had retired
for the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Dik lesti</i>&rsquo;s
<i>p&icirc;ro</i>&rdquo; (look at his foot), said one of the
boys, pointing to a man&rsquo;s bare brown foot protruding from
beneath a tent cover.&nbsp; Within view of Durham&rsquo;s
twinkling lights we sat, and my tobacco pouch having gone the
round, we were soon deep in the sayings and doings of the
Watlands of other days, for when business is off Gypsies ever
talk of Gypsies.&nbsp; As I looked at these <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>folk, it
seemed as though behind them through the dusk peered the shades
of Romanies of an older, weirder sort, who shunned contact with
cities and hated <i>gawj&ecirc;</i> (non-Gypsies) with a
bitterness unknown to-day.</p>
<p>Here is a tale of the old times, obtained from grizzled
&ldquo;Durham&rdquo; Mike Watland, and translated more or less
into my own words.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When I was a little fellow, I used to
listen with delight to a blood-curdling story which my
grandfather used to tell as we sat watching the red embers die
out at night.&nbsp; One time he found himself in a strange
predicament, and got such a &ldquo;gliff&rdquo; as he had never
experienced before.&nbsp; This of course was many years ago, for
my grandfather lived to the age of ninety-four, and I am one of
the third generation of a long-lived family of Gypsies.&nbsp; The
ways of our people were a bit different then.&nbsp; In those
days, you saw no harm in taking anything you had a fancy for, if
you could get it.&nbsp; My grandfather was a young fellow, and on
this particular morning he crossed a moor and came to a hamlet
containing three or four straggling houses, and near one of these
stood a cowshed and a low barn.&nbsp; In passing the shed he saw
hanging there a nice porker which had been killed early that
morning, and round it was wrapped a sack to prevent dogs or cats
from gnawing it.&nbsp; All this my grandfather observed as he
hawked his goods at the cottage door, inwardly resolving to pay
Mr. Piggy a visit by night.&nbsp; All was quiet when at a late
hour <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>he
re-crossed the moor and arrived at the shed, on entering which he
put out his hands and felt for the pig where he had seen it
hanging in the morning, but, no, it had been removed.&nbsp; It
then occurred to him that for greater safety it might have been
carried into the low-roofed barn, so in he went and felt all
along the cross-beam.&nbsp; He was right.&nbsp; Sure enough the
pig&rsquo;s face struck cold to his hand.&nbsp; Quickly he cut
the rope, and, slinging piggy across his shoulder, was soon
making his way back to the camping-place.&nbsp; But crossing that
rough land with a heavy load was no easy task, and you may be
sure that the farther he went the heavier it became.&nbsp; When
descending a slope, he caught his foot in a hole, and down he
tumbled with his burden.&nbsp; Now as he arose and laid hold of
the rope in order to hoist the pig once more, the moon came out
from behind a cloud, and revealed the face of&mdash;<i>a dead
man</i>!&nbsp; For a moment he stood mesmerized by fright, then
sick at heart he proceeded to acquaint the nearest constable with
the fact.&nbsp; The corpse was identified as that of a
feeble-minded cottager who had hanged himself in the
barn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One day I was exploring the city of Durham, for my early life
in Lincoln had imbued me with a love of old architecture, and the
nave of Durham minster profoundly gratified my love of the
sombre, when, lo, just over the way, I saw a weather-beaten
<i>v&acirc;do</i> (living-van), and near it was the owner,
looking up and down the street as if expecting someone to
appear.&nbsp; Crossing <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>the road, I greeted the Gypsy, who
turned out to be one of the Winters, a North-Country family to
whom has been applied (not without reason) the epithet
&ldquo;wild,&rdquo; and I remembered how Hoyland, in his
<i>Historical Survey of the Gypsies</i>, had written&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The distinguished Northern poet, Walter
Scott, who is Sheriff of Selkirkshire, has in a very obliging
manner communicated the following statement&mdash;&lsquo; . . .
some of the most atrocious families have been extirpated.&nbsp; I
allude to the Winters, a Northumberland clan, who, I fancy, are
all buried by this time.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Sheriff Scott was wrong.</p>
<p>The Winters had only changed their haunts, and on being driven
out of the Border Country had moved southward.</p>
<p>As I stood chatting with Mr. Winter, his handsome wife came up
with a hawking-basket on her arm.&nbsp; I shall always remember
her in connection with a story she told me.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One day I was sitting on a bank under a
garden hedge.&nbsp; It was a hot day and I was very
thirsty.&nbsp; I said aloud, &lsquo;Oh, for a drink of
beer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Just then a voice came over the hedge, a nice,
clear, silvery voice it was, like as if an angel from heaven was
a-talking to me&mdash;&lsquo;You shall have one, my
dearie.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in a minute or two a kind lady came down
with a big jug of beer.&nbsp; How I did bless that lady for her
kindness to a poor Gypsy, and I drank the lot.&nbsp; About a
month <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>afterwards, I heard of the death of that lady, and I
vowed to myself and to the <i>rawni</i>&rsquo;s <i>muli</i>
(lady&rsquo;s spirit) that I would never touch another drop of
beer as long as I lived, and I never have done and never will no
more.&rdquo;</p>

41</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MY POACHING PUSSY&mdash;A ROMANY
BENISON&mdash;MY FIRST TASTE OF HEDGEHOG</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> clerical life has been spent for
the most part in green country places, chiefly amid wind-swept
hills.&nbsp; Consequently one has learned to delight in the
creatures that run and fly, the wild things of wood and wold and
brookside, and this love of Nature and her children has never
left me; it has companioned with me throughout my
wanderings.&nbsp; Give me now an elevated crest commanding a
broad sweep of field and forest, with the swift rush of keen air
over the furze bushes, a footpath among the thorn-scrub where the
finches chatter, the sedgy bank of a moorland stream from which I
can hear the &ldquo;flup&rdquo; of the trout, or the call of the
peewits somersaulting in the sunlight: simple pleasures are
these, yet they bring a world of happiness to a man who loves the
wilds more than cities, and the windy wold better than the
stifling street.</p>
<p>Contrary to the popular notion that Lincolnshire is no more
than a dreary expanse of black fenland soil intersected by drains
of geometric straightness, I may point out that there are two
well-defined hill <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>ranges extending almost throughout the county&mdash;the
chalk and greensand Wolds, and the limestone
&ldquo;Heights,&rdquo; running parallel after the manner of the
<i>duplex spina</i> of Virgil&rsquo;s well-bred horse.</p>
<p>On the western edge of the Wolds, overlooking a richly varied
landscape, nestles the hamlet where I made my first home after
marriage, and the country lying around our hilltop parsonage was
an ideal hunting-ground for a naturalist.&nbsp; Borne on the rude
March gales the wild pipe of the curlew greeted the ear as you
met the buffeting gusts along the unfrequented ridgeways, and
over winter snows an observant eye might trace the badger&rsquo;s
spoor.&nbsp; On summer evenings when the far-away minster of
Lincoln was a purple cameo upon an amber ground, and the shadows
creeping out of the woods began to spread over the hills, a brown
owl would sail by on noiseless wings, or Reynard might be seen
trotting across the sheep-nibbled sward towards the warren below
the clustering firs.</p>
<p>Rambling along the wold one gleaming autumn afternoon, my
attention was attracted by the rapid movements of some
diminutive, fluffy-looking creature, which to a casual saunterer
might have been a wren or a hedgesparrow; but after having stood
quietly for a moment or two, a dark velvety ball of fur darted
towards me, and in a most confiding manner ran over my boots, and
sniffed at the stout ash-plant which I invariably carry with me
along the lanes.&nbsp; For some time I stood watching the
unconscious <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>play of this tiny mouse.&nbsp; At last, however, I made
a move and my wee friend fled like a thought to his retreat in
the hedge.</p>
<p>On another occasion, I was seated in my old oak stall in the
village church.&nbsp; It was a harvest festival, and a college
friend was in the midst of his sermon, when I distinctly felt
something nibbling at the hem of my cassock.&nbsp; It was a plump
grey mouse, and on moving my foot I saw him speed down the aisle
like an arrow.&nbsp; As fortune had it, the ladies in the front
pew, being properly rapt in the eloquent discourse, escaped the
disquieting vision of my church mousie.</p>
<p>These mice incidents, with a few more like them, were strung
together and dispatched to the <i>Pall Mall Budget</i>, edited at
that time by Mr. Charles Morley.&nbsp; My literary effort was
duly printed, with pleasing sketches from the pencil of that
peerless lover of pussies, Mr. Louis Wain, the then president of
the Cat Club.</p>
<p>It was in the same parish that I had a favourite pussy,
&ldquo;Tony&rdquo; by name, who would daily follow me to church,
and wait at the vestry door for my reappearance after
matin-prayers.&nbsp; But, alas, he acquired the poaching habit, a
sure path to destruction, as I learned one day to my sorrow in
passing the keeper&rsquo;s gibbet at the end of a woodland
glade.</p>
<p>One of my rambles with this pussy I recall quite
vividly.&nbsp; One afternoon I set off across the wold intending
to make pastoral visits upon a few outlying <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>cottagers.&nbsp; I had got about half a mile from home,
and, looking round, there was Tony just at my heels.&nbsp; I
strolled along, and presently heard a squealing, and out of a
clump of nettles came my cat dragging a plump rabbit.&nbsp; It
was dead, and the cat, panting after his effort, looked up at me,
as much as to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to leave it
here, are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon I remembered the saying of
an old Gypsy, &ldquo;If you had a dog that brought a hare or a
rabbit to your feet, wouldn&rsquo;t it be flying in the face of
providence to refuse to take it?&rdquo;&nbsp; So, picking up the
rabbit, I put it in one of the roomy pockets of my long-tailed
coat, and went on.&nbsp; The cat persisted in following.&nbsp; By
and by, we drew near to a disused quarry, where the cat captured
a second rabbit, which went into the other pocket of my long
coat.&nbsp; By this time I began to feel the charm of the sport
of that gentleman who sallies forth on &ldquo;a shiny night at
the season of the year.&rdquo;&nbsp; The pastoral visits had now
perforce to be abandoned, but on turning my face homeward, oh,
horrors! there, not a hundred yards away, was a man on horseback,
accompanied by a dog, and, seeing them, my cat scooted along a
gulley up the hill, and was gone.&nbsp; I could not disappear
quite so easily.&nbsp; However, as I did not altogether fancy a
strange dog sniffing at my coat-tails, I made a detour, and the
horseman passed a good way below me on the slope.&nbsp; You
should have seen my wife smile as I plumped two nice bunnies on
the kitchen table.&nbsp; We observed that those rabbits <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>tasted quite
as good as any you purchase at a game-dealer&rsquo;s stall in the
market.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Gypsies, as all the world knows, are fond of the hedgehog.</p>
<p>They do not keep him as a pet.&nbsp; They eat him, and roast
hedgehog accompanied with sage and onions is a dish for an
episcopal table.&nbsp; I never see one of these prickly fellows
without being reminded of several experiences.</p>
<p>Once in passing along a town street on my way to the
Archdeacon&rsquo;s Visitation, I noticed not far ahead of me an
elderly woman stepping out with a swinging stride.&nbsp; Her face
I could not see, but she wore a tattered shawl about her
shoulders, and her black hair was done up in small plaits like a
horse&rsquo;s mane at fair-time.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gypsy,&rdquo; said
I to myself, and, hastening alongside, I greeted her in the
Romany tongue.&nbsp; The words had a magical effect.&nbsp;
Instantly she wheeled round and scanned me up and down with a
puzzled air.&nbsp; There before her, wearing an orthodox collar
and black coat, stood a parson who nevertheless talked like a
Gypsy.&nbsp; Now in common with some ladies of high degree,
nearly all Gypsy women enjoy a whiff of tobacco smoke.&nbsp; This
old lady, however, declined a gift of the weed on the ground that
&ldquo;the brantitus&rdquo; had troubled her of late, but she
gladly stepped with me into a snug coffeehouse close by, where
over our steaming cups we conversed aloud in the Gypsy language,
to the complete <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>mystification of the prim-looking manageress whose
curiosity kept her hovering near.&nbsp; What that good
woman&rsquo;s thoughts were, I have not the faintest idea.&nbsp;
I only know that she seemed amazed at the sight of a Gypsy in
easy intercourse with a simple-looking cleric who appeared to be
enjoying himself.&nbsp; Both, too, were speaking a queer-sounding
language understandable to each other, but utterly
incomprehensible to the listener.&nbsp; What could it all
mean?&nbsp; Well, Gypsies at anyrate are not without a sense of
humour; indeed, no one enjoys a bit of fun more than they.&nbsp;
Taking in the situation at a glance, my Gypsy companion gave me a
sly look, and, waving her hand playfully, exclaimed, &ldquo;Never
mind him, missis, he&rsquo;s nobbut an Irishman, and can&rsquo;t
a boy and his mither talk a word or two in their own
language?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my taking leave of the Gypsy mother, she bestowed this
benison upon me: &ldquo;The Lord love you, my son, and <i>may you
always have a big hedgehog in your mouth</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hedgehog, as I have said, is a dainty dish with Gypsies, and
the old woman was no more than kindly wishing that there might
ever be a titbit ready to slip into my mouth.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I am not likely to forget the occasion of my first actual
taste of this Romany delicacy.</p>
<p>Charley Watland (brother of &ldquo;Durham&rdquo; Mike), a wide
traveller, had told me much of the delights of a certain
old-fashioned Midland horse-fair, concluding <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>one of his
glowing descriptions by inviting me to meet him in mid-September
at this fair.&nbsp; Thus it came to pass that I set out one fine
morning with my face towards the distant hills of
Leicestershire.&nbsp; Of the day-long journey, I am now concerned
only with its closing scenes.&nbsp; Pushing up a long, tiring
hill, I spied over a hedge in the dusk two or three
<i>v&acirc;d&ecirc;</i> (living-vans), some low tents with
flickering fires before them, and dark figures moving to and
fro.&nbsp; With what energy I had left, I climbed over a fence
and made straight for the Gypsy fires.&nbsp; A tall
<i>Romanitshel</i>, leaning against a tree-bole, was singing
snatches of a song in which I caught the words <i>Beng</i>
(Devil) and <i>puri-dai</i> (grandmother), but, on seeing a
stranger approach, he ceased.&nbsp; The Romany greeting, which I
flung on the evening air, caused a stoutish woman to thrust her
head from the doorway of the nearest caravan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s one o&rsquo; the Lees, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.&nbsp; He talks like &rsquo;em.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s come back
from over the <i>p&acirc;ni</i>&rdquo; (water).&nbsp; Which,
being interpreted, meant that I was a &ldquo;lag&rsquo;s&rdquo;
boy returned from over-sea.&nbsp; The idea tickled me so that I
laughed outright.</p>
<p>Beside the fire which was burning brightly at the feet of the
tall Gypsy man, children and dogs were rolling over one another
in perfect happiness, and at my elbow a lad, peering into my
face, exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swop <i>diklo</i>s (kerchiefs) with you,
<i>rai</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I replied;
&ldquo;mine&rsquo;s silk and yours cotton.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;<i>Pen mandi</i>, <i>baw</i>&rdquo; (Tell me,
friend), I inquired of the tall man under the trees, &ldquo;Is
Charley Watland here this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Keka</i>, <i>mi pal</i>, the <i>puro</i>&rsquo;s
<i>poger</i>&rsquo;d his <i>h&#277;ro</i> (No, my brother, the
old man&rsquo;s broken his leg) at Peterborough.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
got kicked by a hoss, and he&rsquo;s in the
infirmary.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was bad news, for I had hoped to
meet my friend here and spend the night with him.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A little way across the fields the lights of a village gleamed
through the darkness, and, making my way thither, I sought for a
resting-place, but in vain.&nbsp; Every available bed was already
engaged.&nbsp; In and out of the taverns passed horse-dealers and
rollicking Gypsies.&nbsp; Groups of Romany lads and lasses stood
talking in the lane.&nbsp; Burly women with foaming jugs bumped
against you in the shadows.&nbsp; Between the barking of dogs and
the whinnying of horses, a word or two of Romany floated now and
then to one&rsquo;s ear.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Tired after my day in the open air, I turned into a by-lane to
think matters over.&nbsp; A gentle wind rustled the leaves on the
trees, and on the eastern horizon a growing light told of
approaching moon-rise.&nbsp; I sat on a fence and watched Old
Silver appear above the hills.&nbsp; Away from the village, I
began to notice the sights and sounds of night.&nbsp; An owl on
velvety wing fluttered by.&nbsp; Little birds cheeped in the
thicket behind me.&nbsp; Field-mice squeaked in the grass on the
bank.&nbsp; I <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>began to feel cut off from the world.&nbsp; What was I
to do?&nbsp; Walk about all night?&nbsp; Make a bed on the
bracken in a neighbouring wood?&nbsp; Renew my search for a more
civilized couch in one or other of the adjacent villages?&nbsp;
Tramp down the long dusty road to a small town some few miles
off, where I knew of more than one snug hostelry?&nbsp; Why
indeed?&nbsp; Was I not out for adventure?&nbsp; I resolved to
ask the Gypsies to give me a bed.&nbsp; Therefore, without
further ado, I slipped through a gap in the hedge, and made
tracks for the Gypsy fires already mentioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, here&rsquo;s the <i>rai</i> back
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the tall Gypsy&rsquo;s wife who
spoke.&nbsp; My tale was soon told, and I was promptly offered a
corner under Arthur West&rsquo;s tilt-hood placed tent-wise on
the ground.&nbsp; Now that my mind was at ease, I sat me down by
the fire near which a savoury smell of supper arose.&nbsp; It was
astonishing how quickly we cleaned the bones of several bird-like
objects set before us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever taste of these little things
afore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever they are, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind if they
had been larger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this they all laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dawdi</i>, the <i>rai</i> doesn&rsquo;t <i>jin</i>
he&rsquo;s <i>haw</i>&rsquo;d <i>hotshwitshi</i>&rdquo; (Fancy,
the gentleman doesn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;s eaten hedgehog).</p>
<p>So this was the much-vaunted Romany dish, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>nor did it
disappoint me.&nbsp; The blended flavours of pheasant and
sucking-pig are still present to my memory as I recall that
moonlit meal washed down by a jug of brown ale.</p>
<p>On awaking next morning, I realized the truth of the saying,
&ldquo;Gypsies get something straight from heaven which is never
known to people who sleep in stuffy houses and get up to wash in
warm water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I recall awakenings in lodgings with the bedclothes,
valances, curtains, falderals, antimacassars, all heavy with
suggestions of humanity, I marvel no more at the Gypsy&rsquo;s
choice of a bed of crisp bracken or sweet straw, with maybe a
wisp of dried river-mint or wild thyme mingled with it.</p>
<p>Walking bare-foot in the dewy grass with the Gypsy children,
we made our toilet together in the open, with the light airs of
the wold playing about us.&nbsp; Then came breakfast by the wood
fire, and during the meal my host&rsquo;s donkey affectionately
put his cold nose on the bare of my neck.&nbsp; In a little while
we stood on the common where the fair was in full swing, and,
strolling among the horses and dealers, I spied a curly-haired
son of old Horace Boswell, just arrived from Leicester, who found
time to tell me a funny tale about his father.</p>
<p>Since early morn Horace had been riding a lively horse, and,
dismounting, handed the reins to <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>a pal and walked a few yards into the
fair.&nbsp; As he was looking about him, he lighted upon George
Smith of Coalville, who, arching his bushy eyebrows and stroking
his great beard, stood shocked at the sight of a Gypsy walking
unsteadily.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, Horace&rsquo;s legs had
not yet thrown off the cramp of many hours&rsquo; riding on a
skittish animal.&nbsp; When solemn George opened his mouth it was
to ask a question&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you drink beer, my good man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my kind gentleman,&rdquo; replied Horace,
&ldquo;afore I answers that question, I&rsquo;d reely like to
know whether it&rsquo;s a simple inquiry or an
inwitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for the worthy philanthropist who, turning
swiftly on his heel, went his way swinging his Gladstone-bag and
gingham.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon I sought out my hospitable
friend Arthur West before quitting the fair, and, looking me
straight in the eyes, he said, &ldquo;Are you quite sure that you
have enough <i>lova</i> (money) to see you home?&nbsp; For if I
thought you hadn&rsquo;t, I should chuck a handful on the
<i>drom</i> (road) and leave it for you to pick up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How shall we ever get you to understand the spirit of these
wanderers; you who coddle yourselves in hot, close rooms; who are
wedded to the life of a mill-horse jogging in convention&rsquo;s
dusty track, and whose souls are imprisoned within the dimensions

<span class="GutSmall">A GYPSY BAPTISM&mdash;ROMANY
NAMES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Quitting</span> the Wolds, described in
the preceding chapter, I took up my abode in a large village
situated on Lincoln Heath, where I had further opportunities of
pursuing my Gypsy studies round about home.</p>
<p>In a sinuous turfy lane which ran behind our house, the
Gypsies would pitch their camp from time to time, and one of
these wandering families conceived the notion of renting a
cottage in the village.&nbsp; In my mind&rsquo;s eye I can see
that little house, wearing a lost, desolate air.&nbsp; It stood
in a walled-in yard, where loose stones lay strewn, and the ridge
of the red-tiled roof sunken in the middle threatened a
collapse.</p>
<p>Unaccustomed to sleeping under a roof, and a rickety one at
that, the Gypsies fled in alarm from their chamber one wild,
boisterous night, fearing lest the chimney-pots should tumble in
upon them.&nbsp; Near by stood their green caravan, and snugly
abed therein they felt secure from all harm.&nbsp; Next day a
timid rap came at the Rectory door, and a black-eyed girl
whispered in my ear that her mother <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>would like the baby, a few hours old,
to be christened.&nbsp; This I did, and a day or two afterwards I
was agreeably surprised to meet the Gypsy mother with her baby
taking the fresh air on the high road.&nbsp; What mother in any
other rank of life could carry her child in the open so soon
after its birth?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a way we have,&rdquo; said Walter Heron,
when explaining to me that a plate, cup, and saucer are set apart
for the mother&rsquo;s use during the four weeks following the
birth of a child.&nbsp; The vessels are then destroyed in
accordance with an old puerperal tabu.&nbsp; This custom is still
observed in all good Romany families.</p>
<p>Tom Lee, an English Gypsy, broke up a loaf of bread and
strewed the crumbs around his tent when his son Bendigo was born,
for some of the old-time Gypsies hold the notion that bread
possesses a protective magic against evil influences.&nbsp;
Seated one day in the tent of Bendigo Lee on the South Shore at
Blackpool, I questioned him about his father&rsquo;s
practice.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the days when I was born,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;there were people that could do hurt by looking
at you, and I s&rsquo;pose my <i>dadus</i> (father) sprinkled the
crumbs lest any evil person going by should cast harm upon
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A distinct survival of the belief in the evil eye.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Romany &ldquo;fore,&rdquo; or Christian names, <a
name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53"
class="citation">[53]</a> are often peculiar, and afford much
material for reflection.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>Whence
come such names as Khulai, Maireni, Malini, Mori, Shuri?&nbsp; In
these names Sir Richard Temple discerns Indian forms or
terminations.&nbsp; The Anglo-Romany names, Fenela, Siari, and
Trenit, have been identified by Mr. H. T. Crofton with the
Continental forms, Vennel, Cihari, and Tranitza, the last being a
common feminine Gypsy name in Hungary.</p>
<p>Euphonious and out-of-the-way names are irresistible to the
Gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What metal is that box made of, sir?&rdquo; asked a
Gypsy mother on seeing a gentleman&rsquo;s cigarette-case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aluminium,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a beautiful name for my gell&rsquo;s
baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Charles G. Leland, a Gypsy father, hearing two
gentlemen talking about Mount Vesuvius, was greatly impressed by
the name, and consulted with them as to the propriety of giving
it to his little boy.</p>
<p>Gypsies dislike to be addressed by their peculiar
&ldquo;fore&rdquo; or Christian names in the presence of
<i>gawj&ecirc;</i>; hence to the postman, &Egrave;nos become
Amos, F&egrave;mi&mdash;Amy, and Poley&mdash;George, and so
on.&nbsp; As a rule, you find a Gypsy is unwilling to impart his
true name to a stranger.&nbsp; May not this reluctance be due to
a lingering subconscious belief that the possession of
one&rsquo;s true name would enable a stranger to work harmful
spells upon the owner?</p>
<p>Time was when the belief was widely spread <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>that the
utterance of a man&rsquo;s true name drew him to the
speaker.&nbsp; Medieval records are full of legendary accounts of
spirits who were summoned by the casual pronunciation of their
names.&nbsp; Until lately there were peasants in the North of
Ireland and Arran who absolutely refused to tell their names to a
stranger because such knowledge, it was believed, would enable
him to &ldquo;call&rdquo; them, no matter how far he was from
them, and whenever he cared to do so.&nbsp; They also believed
that any spell worked on the written name would have the same
effect as if worked on the owner.</p>
<p>It is a fact that not a few Gypsy surnames are identical with
those of ancient noble families, <i>e.g.</i> Boswell, or Bosville
(sometimes contracted to Boss), Gray, Heron, Hearne, or Herne,
Lees, Lovells, and Stanleys.&nbsp; It has been surmised, by way
of explanation, that the Gypsies soon after their arrival in this
country adopted the surnames of the owners of the estates on
which particular hordes usually encamped, or the names of those
landed families who afforded protection to the persecuted
wanderers.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Gypsies, Gilbert White of Selborne, says,
&ldquo;One of these tribes calls itself by the noble name of
Stanley.&rdquo;&nbsp; This mention of the Stanleys reminds me
that once on Gonerby Hill, near Grantham, on the Great North
Road, I met a young man who looked like a mechanic out of work,
yet his bearing was that of a Gypsy.&nbsp; In our talk he
admitted that he was of Romany blood.&nbsp; He had <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>been a
horseman in Lord George Sanger&rsquo;s circus, but something had
gone wrong and he was thrown out of employ.&nbsp; At first he
gave his name as Richardson (not a Gypsy name), but he afterwards
told me that his grandfather, a Stanley, had been transported,
for which reason the family assumed the name of Richardson.</p>
<h2><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">I MAKE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> several years I was
curate-in-charge of a parish abutting upon the Great North Road,
and during that time I used to meet many Gypsies on the famous
highway.&nbsp; There passed along it members of the Boswell clan,
making their way from Edinburgh to London; the dark Herons, after
spending the summer months in the Northern Counties, came by this
route to their winter quarters at Nottingham; a lawless horde of
Lovells also knew this road well.&nbsp; Sometimes these Gypsies
would turn aside from the dusty highway for a brief rest in the
green lanes across an adjacent river, but they rarely tarried
longer than a day.&nbsp; With one of these Gypsies I became
intimately acquainted, and this is how our friendship began.</p>
<p>One May morning I had been strolling along the aforesaid road,
and, turning towards the river where it is spanned by an old
mill-bridge, I loitered there in expectation of the arrival of a
pack of otter-hounds, visitors from another county; for
complaints had long been accumulating to the effect that
<i>Lutra</i> had been making depredations among the fish, game,
and poultry all along the reaches of the river.&nbsp; Adjoining
<a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the bridge
was a watermill where often might be heard the humming of the
great wheel and the roar of foam-flecked water.&nbsp; Mellowed by
time&rsquo;s gentle touch, the irregular outlines of the building
seemed verily as if arranged to be imaged on canvas; timbers and
weathered stones were everywhere mottled with rosettes of orange
and grey lichen, and when the sunbeams warmed the tints and tones
of the old mill into rich masses of colour you experienced a
thrill which made you wish to repeat it.</p>
<p>A little way off, our river was crossed by a shallow ford
rarely used by vehicular traffic, which mostly passed by the
bridge.&nbsp; Once a year, however, the miller closed the bridge
in order to preserve a right-of-way through his yard, and on this
occasion toll was taken of every cart, while a free way was
allowed by the ford.&nbsp; But the astute fellow usually arranged
that the closing of the bridge should coincide with a market day
at the nearest town, and he would choose a time when the river
was swollen by flood-water beyond its ordinary dimensions, thus
rendering the ford a dangerous crossing.</p>
<p>After waiting awhile, a murmur of deep voices broke upon my
ear, as with a rush and a splash about a score of bonny,
rough-coated dogs burst into view round a bend in the
stream.&nbsp; It was not in my plans to follow the dogs, so when
the pack and its excited companions had gone by, I proceeded
leisurely along a lane leading towards the green uplands looking
down upon the valley.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>A
little way up the lane I came upon two dark-featured lads, and,
going up to one of them who was tacking strips of straw-plait
upon the top of a three-legged table, I said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem very busy this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something for a living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly a good hand at your
business.&nbsp; How long are you stopping here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s more nor I know.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This with a
shrewd look at me from top to toe.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Ax grandfather,
up yonder wi&rsquo; the hosses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higher up the lane, and almost hidden by outlying tangles of
bramble and wild-rose, sat a man of sixty or more, puffing
tobacco smoke from his black clay, and near him on the wayside
three horses ripped the tender grasses.</p>
<p>Looking up at me with a start, the man said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you fairly took me by surprise, sir.&nbsp; For a
wonder I never heard you a-coming.&nbsp; I must be getting
deaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Romanitshel</i>?&rdquo; (Gypsy) I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;vali</i>, <i>mi tshavo</i>&rdquo; (Yes, my
son), he replied; &ldquo;you&rsquo;s been among our people,
that&rsquo;s plain, or you wouldn&rsquo;t talk like you do.&nbsp;
Mebbe you&rsquo;s heard tell o&rsquo; Jonathan
Boswell&mdash;that&rsquo;s me.&nbsp; But I must be off now with
these here hosses to the smithy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;s <i>besh</i>in
<i>akai</i> (stopping here) for a day or two.&nbsp; Our
wagon&rsquo;s in the <i>kitshima</i> (tavern) yard just past the
mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jonathan, I want you to bring one of <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>those
Gypsy-tables the boys are making to my place this afternoon;
don&rsquo;t fail to come.&nbsp; I shall <i>dik avr&icirc;</i> for
<i>t&icirc;ro mui</i> about <i>trin ora</i>&rdquo; (look out for
your face about three o&rsquo;clock).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, I&rsquo;ll be there, <i>raia</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In due course the Gypsy presented himself at my door in
company with his two grandsons, and among them they carried three
tables.&nbsp; I had only asked for one, but Jonathan was such a
&ldquo;find&rdquo; that I gladly purchased all the articles and
bade the little party follow me into the garden.&nbsp; The two
grandsons displayed a remarkable knowledge of trees, which they
were able to identify not merely by their foliage, but by the
character of their bark.&nbsp; Wild birds they knew by note and
flight as well as by plumage.&nbsp; There is so much a Gypsy boy
knows about nature.</p>
<p>How meagre, by contrast, is the information possessed by the
average County Council schoolboy; which reminds me that I was
once giving an object-lesson to a class of fifth-standard
children attending our village school.&nbsp; We were seated on a
river bank whose insect life and botanical treasures I had been
pointing out to an interested group of listeners.&nbsp; As
nothing had been said about the scaly denizens of the stream, I
concluded my talk by putting a question to the entire class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up, those who can tell me the names of any fish
to be found in this river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly a dozen pink palms were uplifted, and I could see that
several lips were bursting with information.&nbsp; <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Imagine my
surprise when I was informed&mdash;&ldquo;red-herring, sprats,
and mackerel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following evening I went across the fields to see my
friends by the watermill.&nbsp; The amber light of sunset was
falling upon green hedge and rippling river.&nbsp; From a thorn
bush a nightingale jug-jugged deliciously.&nbsp; There was poetry
in the air.&nbsp; Nor was it dispelled by the discovery that my
friends had drawn their &ldquo;house on wheels&rdquo; into the
grassy lane leading down to the ford.</p>
<p>Seated on a mound of sand, Jonathan was chatting with a
stranger who had the looks of an Irishman.&nbsp; I joined them,
but no sooner had I dropped a word or two of Romany than the
stranger arose, saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand your
talk, so I&rsquo;d better be going.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then left us,
and, seeing he had gone away, old Fazenti, Jonathan&rsquo;s wife,
stepped down from the living-wagon, and our discourse became
considerably enlivened by her presence.</p>
<p>Speaking of <i>duker</i>in (fortune-telling), she said,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll go on while the world lasts,&rdquo; which was
Fazzy&rsquo;s way of saying that the credulous will be in the
world after the poor have left it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
hawking-basket that gi&rsquo;s us our chance, don&rsquo;t you
<i>dik</i> (see)?&nbsp; I takes care never to be without my
licence, and the <i>muskro</i> (policeman) would have to get up
wery early to catch old Fazzy asleep.&nbsp; Did I ever have any
<i>mulo-mas</i>? <a name="citation61"></a><a href="#footnote61"
class="citation">[61]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Many&rsquo;s the time I&rsquo;ve had
a bit.&nbsp; In spring, when lambs are about, that&rsquo;s the
time for <i>mulo-mas</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good country for hedgehogs is this, but we
don&rsquo;t eat &rsquo;em in the spring.&nbsp; The back end of
the year is the best time for &rsquo;em; there&rsquo;s a bit of
flesh on &rsquo;em then.&nbsp; When you find one, if he&rsquo;s
rolled up in a ball, you rub his back with a stick right down his
spine, and he&rsquo;ll open out fast enough.&nbsp; Then you hit
him hard on the nose, and he&rsquo;s as dead as a door
nail.&nbsp; The old way of cooking him was to cover him with clay
and bake him in the fire.&nbsp; When he was cooked you tapped the
clay ball, and the prickles and skin came away with the
clay.&nbsp; Nowadays we burn down the bristles, then shave
&rsquo;em off, draw and clean him and roast him on a spit before
a hot fire.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s wery good with <i>puvengri</i>s
(potatoes), sage, and onions.&nbsp; <i>Bouri</i>s (snails) are
good to eat in winter.&nbsp; You get them in a hard frost from
behind old stumps of trees.&nbsp; You put salt on &rsquo;em and
they make fine broth.&nbsp; Wery strengthening is
<i>bouri-zimen</i>&rdquo; (snail broth).</p>

</a></p>
<p>While we were conversing, Jonathan&rsquo;s grandsons passed by
with a lurcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A useful dog, that, I should think,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Kushto yek s&icirc; dova</i> for <i>shushiaw</i> and
<i>kanengr&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (A good one is that for rabbits and
hares), replied the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I minds well the day I
bought him off a man with a pot-cart as was stopping along with
us.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d got leave from a farmer to draw into a lane
running between some clover fields, and we were <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>just sitting
down to a cup o&rsquo; tea when a keeper comes along and
says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid some of you fellows have been
up to mischief, because there&rsquo;s a hare in a snare along
this hedge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s somebody else&rsquo;s snare, not
ours,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;for we&rsquo;s only just got here,
and yon farmer as give us leave to stop will tell you the same if
you ask him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, see here,&rsquo; says the keeper,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s a rabbit for your pot.&nbsp; Keep a sharp
look out, and mind you let me know if anybody comes to fetch that
hare.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s my cottage up yonder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he went away, and would you believe it, a bit
after the moon got up we see a man coming across the field and
straight to that snare he went, and as he was taking the hare out
of it, there was a tap on his shoulder from the keeper.&nbsp;
Now, who do you think the man was that got catched so
nicely?&nbsp; <i>It was the willage policeman</i>.&nbsp; And that
night I bought that here <i>jukel</i> (dog), I did, and me and
the dog had a fine time among the <i>shushiaw</i> (rabbits) after
the keeper and the policeman had gone away.&nbsp; About a week
after, the <i>muskro</i> (policeman) had to appear in court, and
a wery poor figure he cut afore the <i>pukinger</i>
(magistrate).&nbsp; You see, he was catched proper, and
couldn&rsquo;t get out of it no-how.&nbsp; The pot-cart man and
me had to go up as witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know this countryside well, I
expect.&nbsp; <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>Do you ever spend the night in Dark Lane, as I believe
they call it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One time we used to stop there a lot, <i>rai</i>, but
they won&rsquo;t let us now.&nbsp; How&rsquo;smiver, we <i>hatsh
odoi</i> (encamp there) for a <i>r&acirc;ti</i> (night) at odd
times, spite of everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark was accompanied by a half-smothered chuckle from
Jonathan, who, while filling his pipe from my tobacco pouch,
seemed to be ruminating upon a reminiscence which presently came
out.</p>
<p>The said lane lies pleasantly between a neighbouring village
and the river, and about the month of May the grass down there
begins to be sweet, but woe to the Gypsies whom the constable
finds encamped thereabouts.</p>
<p>Jonathan went on to tell how he and his party once passed a
night very happily there when the may-buds were bursting.&nbsp;
And this is how it was done.</p>
<p>In a wayside tavern the Gypsy had heard it whispered that the
County Police had gone to the town for the annual inspection,
which involved a temporary absence of the constables from their
respective localities.&nbsp; But, to make quite sure of this, on
arriving at the village of F&mdash;, Jonathan sought out a
certain cottage and thus addressed himself to a constable&rsquo;s
wife&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the sergeant at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my man.&nbsp; What do you want him for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pony of mine has gone astray, and I want <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>him to let me
know if he hears anything about it.&nbsp; Perhaps he&rsquo;ll be
at home to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Jonathan camped down Dark Lane with impunity.</p>
<p>One morning shortly after my meeting with Jonathan, a Gypsy
mother called at my Rectory.&nbsp; She led her black-eyed,
five-year-old boy by the hand.&nbsp; Brown as a berry, the
handsome little fellow would have served admirably for an
artist&rsquo;s model, and his mother had many pleasing touches of
Gypsy colour about her attire.&nbsp; From beneath a bright red
<i>diklo</i> (kerchief) which she wore, a few black curls
straggled out on to her forehead, and a gay bodice showed under
her green shawl.&nbsp; The woman said that she had heard so much
of me from her father&mdash;Jonathan Boswell&mdash;that she had
come on purpose to see me.&nbsp; I invited her into the kitchen,
and over bread and cheese and ale we chatted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we all delated, <i>raia</i>, come to think
of it?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a Man above as made us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly I made friends with the little boy, and at my request
his mother afforded our household no small delight by leaving her
son with us for the day.&nbsp; The tiny lad was entirely
unaccustomed to house ways, and his behaviour was a study.&nbsp;
On seeing a Christmas card with the Christ-child lying in the
manger guarded by a white-winged angel, he exclaimed, <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>&ldquo;I know
what that is&rdquo; (pointing to the heavenly visitant);
&ldquo;we often sees &rsquo;em flying over the fields.&nbsp;
<i>It&rsquo;s a seagull</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great readiness he joined in the games of my children,
such as shuttlecock and battledore, skipping, and the like.&nbsp;
Sitting at a table for a meal was evidently a novel experience
for the little chap, and it was amusing to see him slip off his
chair and squat on the hearthrug, putting his plate on his knee
as though a Gypsy boy ought not to do exactly as the
<i>gawj&ecirc;</i>, and he used his fingers freely in lieu of
fork and spoon.&nbsp; After the meal we sat round the fire, and
talked of his life on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a hen&rsquo;s nest in the hedge-bottom, this
morning, I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any eggs in?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I left &rsquo;em&mdash;<i>till there was
more</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I told him fairy tales of green woods, ghosts, and
goblins, and he became excited, springing once or twice from his
chair, as if he would like to have danced about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I knows a lot about <i>mulo</i>s&rdquo; (ghosts),
said the little Gypsy.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s different
sorts&mdash;milk-white &rsquo;uns and coal-black
&rsquo;uns.&nbsp; When we&rsquo;re abed at nights, they come
screaming round our wagon and flapping at the windows.&nbsp; My
daddy gets his gun and shoots, then we hears &rsquo;em no more
for a bit.&nbsp; But they are soon back agen, and I&rsquo;m that
frit <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>when
I hears &rsquo;em, I can&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; When mammy&rsquo;s
going out with her basket of a morning, and daddy&rsquo;s gone
somewhere to see about a hoss, I daren&rsquo;t go far into the
big wood agen our stopping-place, &rsquo;cos of the black pig
what lives there.&nbsp; Daddy has seen it, and nobody can&rsquo;t
kill it, for you can bang a stick right through it without
hurting it.&nbsp; Mammy allus says, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you never
go into that wood, else the black pig&rsquo;ll get
you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We showed him picture books, and, pointing to an ass and a
foal, he said, &ldquo;My daddy&rsquo;s got a little donkey just
like that, three months old, and when it&rsquo;s bigger I shall
ride on it, like that man&rsquo;s doing in the
pictur&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We rambled in the Rectory garden, and he quickly found a
hedgehog in its nest.&nbsp; All the senses of this little fellow
were extremely alert.</p>
<p>In the early evening his mother returned for him, and their
meeting was a pretty sight.&nbsp; Placing her hawking-basket on
the ground, she picked up her laddie in her arms and kissed
him.&nbsp; Slowly the pair walked away, casting more than one
backward glance at the house.</p>
<p>A few days later, news reached me of a Gypsy arrival in a
green lane about a mile from my Rectory.&nbsp; I therefore
hastened across the fields, and, long before sighting the party,
whiffs of wood-smoke, which the breeze brought my way, told that
they were already encamped.&nbsp; On reaching the spot, Farmer
W&mdash;&rsquo;s best bullock pasture, I spied <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Jonathan&rsquo;s cart along with other vehicles drawn up
with their backs towards a high hedge.&nbsp; There were fires on
the grass, and from family groups merry voices rang out on the
air.&nbsp; In the lane a troop of children were hovering around a
little black donkey, a pretty young foal, which allowed them to
fondle it to their hearts&rsquo; content.&nbsp; What a picture it
was which greeted me&mdash;tree-boles, tilt-carts, and hedgerows
lit up by the fading sunlight, and the blue smoke of the fires
wafted about the undulating field dipping down to the
river.&nbsp; Quickly I dropped into a corner by one of the fires,
and the mirth was just at its height when up rode Farmer W&mdash;
on his chestnut cob.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that scamp of a Boswell?&rdquo; he
shouted angrily.</p>
<p>Jonathan stepped forward, hanging his head somewhat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does all this mean?&rdquo; asked the farmer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought it was only for yourself that you begged leave
to stop here.&nbsp; Who the divil&rsquo;s all this
gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; said
Jonathan.&nbsp; &ldquo;They stuck to me, and would come in.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re all delations of mine, don&rsquo;t you see,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look from the Gypsy made me step forward and plead for the
party, which I did with success.</p>

</a></p>
<p>About the middle of June I was again in Old Boswell&rsquo;s
company.&nbsp; Under a hedge pink with wild-roses, we sat smoking
and waiting for the fair to begin on Stow Green, a South
Lincolnshire common.&nbsp; <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Already horses were assembling and
dealers were beginning to arrive in all sorts of
conveyances.&nbsp; Hot sunshine blazed down upon the common,
whose only building was a wretched-looking lockup, around which
lounged several representatives of the county constabulary.&nbsp;
Wandering in and about the motley throng, I caught a whisper
going the round that a fight was to take place before the end of
the day.&nbsp; It had been explained to me that this fight was
not the result of any quarrel arising at the fair.&nbsp; It had
been arranged long beforehand.&nbsp; Whenever a difference arose
between two families, champions were told off to fight the matter
out at Stow Green Fair.</p>
<p>Somewhere about the middle of the afternoon, as the business
began to slacken, a number of people were seen to move to one
corner of the common.&nbsp; Evidently something was afoot.&nbsp;
I wandered across and found a crowd consisting mainly of Gypsies,
and in order to get a better view, I climbed upon a trestle table
outside a booth.&nbsp; In the middle of a ring of people stood
two of the dark Grays, stripped to the waist, and, at a signal
given by an elderly man, the combatants put up their
&ldquo;maulers&rdquo; and the fight began.&nbsp; It was by no
means a one-sided contest, the men being well matched with regard
to weight and strength.&nbsp; Blow followed blow in quick
succession, and at the first drawing of blood the Gypsy onlookers
became excited, and the entire crowd began to surge to and
fro.&nbsp; Of course, the <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>police hurried up, but soon perceived
that it was useless to interfere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em have it out,&rdquo; cried many
voices.&nbsp; After a breathing space, the fighters again closed
in, and, parting a little, one of them stepped back a pace or two
and, springing towards his opponent, dealt him a heavy blow which
determined the battle, and all was over.&nbsp; At this juncture,
the table on which I and others stood suddenly gave way, and we
were precipitated to the grass, but no harm was done, beyond a
few bruises and the shattering of sundry jugs and glasses.</p>
<p>An echo of a fighting song haunts me as I recall this Gypsy
contest on Stow Green&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whack it on the grinders, thump it on the
jaw,<br />
Smack it on the tater-trap a dozen times or more.<br />
Slap it on the snuff-box, make the claret fly,<br />
Thump it on the jaw again, never say die.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the fair was over I sat under a hedge and took tea with
Jonathan and Fazenti.</p>
<p>A hare&rsquo;s back adorned my plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, I didn&rsquo;t know that this was in
season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My <i>dinelo</i> (simpleton), don&rsquo;t you
<i>jin</i> (know) <i>it&rsquo;s always in season with the likes
of us</i>?&rdquo;</p>

71</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BLACKPOOL GYPSYRY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been said that if an
architect, a caterer, and a poet were commissioned to construct
out of our existing south and east coast resorts a place which,
in its appeal to the million, might compare with Blackpool, they
would utterly fail, a saying not to be questioned for a
moment.</p>
<p>Yet the sight which thrilled me most, as I beheld it years
ago, was not the cluster of gilded pleasure-palaces in the town,
but the gay Gypsyry squatting on the sand-dunes at the extremity
of the South Shore.&nbsp; Living-vans of green and gold with
their flapping canvas covers; domed tents whose blankets of red
and grey had faded at the touch of sun and wind; boarden porches
and outgrowths of a fantastic character, the work of Romany
carpenters; unabashed advertisements announcing Gypsy queens
patronized by duchesses and lords; bevies of black-eyed,
wheedling witches eager to pounce upon the stroller into
Gypsydom; and troops of fine children, shock-headed and
jolly&mdash;all these I beheld in the Gypsyry which is now no
more.&nbsp; &ldquo;Life enjoyed to the last&rdquo; might well
have been its epitaph.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Those
were the days of Old Sarah Boswell and her nephews Kenza and
Oscar; Johnny and Wasti Gray; Elijah Heron and his son Poley;
Bendigo and Morjiana Purum; the vivacious Robinsons; Dolferus
Petulengro and Noarus T&acirc;no; some of whom, alas, &ldquo;have
joined the people whom no true Romany will call by
name.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Hot June sunshine flooded the sandhills on the afternoon of my
entry into the encampment, which, by the way, was made
strategetically from the rear.&nbsp; Thus it was that I lighted
upon the retired tent of the oldest occupants of the
Gypsyry.&nbsp; Unlike the alert and expectant Romany mothers and
maids who hovered about this Gypsy town&rsquo;s front gate, Ned
Boswell&rsquo;s widow sat drowsing at the tent door, overpowered
by the midsummer heat.&nbsp; I was about to turn away, intending
to revisit the old lady later on, when her son Alma, the
lynx-eyed, popped upon me from round the corner, and in a sandy
hollow a little way off we were soon deep in conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, <i>rashai</i>,&rdquo; said Alma, after we had
talked awhile, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s one thing I would like to ask
you.&nbsp; Where do you think us <i>Romanitshel</i>s reely
origin&rsquo;d from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here I was confronted by a question which has been asked
throughout the ages, and addressed to myself how many times?</p>
<p>Who are the Gypsies, and where did they come from?&nbsp; Bulky
tomes have been filled with scholarly speculations upon these
questions, and so varied have <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>been the conclusions arrived at that
we appear to be no nearer to the solution of the mystery than
when about the year 1777 the German Rudiger first made known to
the world that the Gypsies spoke an Indian dialect, which
discovery is said &ldquo;to have injured more than it served in
the quest after the origin of the Gypsies, because it has
prevented scholars from searching for it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taking
philology for our guide, we may believe that the ancestors of our
Gypsies tarried for centuries in North-West India, a region which
they quitted with their faces set towards the west not later than
about 1000 <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>&nbsp; To quote the
words of an authority <a name="citation73"></a><a
href="#footnote73" class="citation">[73]</a> on the linguistic
side of the problem: &ldquo;Their language proves that they once
inhabited Northern India, but as no Indian writers have left any
documents describing this people, their mode of life in India,
and the most interesting point of all, why they emigrated, must
for ever remain a matter for conjecture.&nbsp; It is, however,
surprising what can be proved from our present knowledge of their
language, which, it is generally admitted, must rank as an
independent eighth among the seven modern Indian languages of the
Aryan stock, based on Sanskrit.&nbsp; To begin with, the
grammatical peculiarities of the language of the Gypsies resemble
those of the modern Aryan languages of India so closely that it
is impossible not to believe that they were developed side by
side.&nbsp; Comparing Gypsy and Hindi, for example, we find that
their declensions are based exactly on <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>the same principle, that neither has
a real genitive case, that both decline their adjectives only
when used as nouns.&nbsp; Now it is generally held that these
modern forms came slowly into existence throughout the eleventh
century, when the old synthetical structure of the Sanskrit was
broken up and thrown into confusion, but not quite lost, while
the modern auxiliary verbs and prepositions were as yet hardly
fully established in their stead.&nbsp; Therefore, it is
extremely unlikely that the Gypsies left India before the tenth
century, when they could have carried away with them, so to
speak, the germs of the new construction, absorbed on Indian
soil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the words they borrowed from Persia, Armenia, and Greece,
we know that the wanderers passed through these countries on
their way westward, but, since no Arabic or Coptic words are
found in the Gypsy tongue, we infer that they were never in
Egypt.&nbsp; The theory of the Egyptian origin of the
<i>Romanitshel</i>s probably arose from legends which they
themselves set afloat.</p>
<p>Two stories were repeated by the Gypsies.&nbsp; They said that
they were Egyptian penitents on a seven years&rsquo;
pilgrimage.&nbsp; The Saracens had attacked them in Egypt, and,
having surrendered to their enemies, they became Saracens
themselves and denied Christ.&nbsp; Now, as a penance, they were
ordered to travel for seven years without sleeping in a
bed.&nbsp; A second story was that their exile was a punishment
for the sin of having refused hospitality to Joseph and <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>the Virgin
Mary when they fled into Egypt with the newborn Christ-child to
escape the anger of Herod.</p>
<p>Associated with the Gypsies are other legends which may have
been invented by them for similar purposes.&nbsp; An old
tradition asserts that Caspar, one of the three Magi, was a
Gypsy, and that it was he who (as their ruler) first converted
them to the Christian religion.&nbsp; The Lithuanian Gypsies say
that stealing has been permitted in their favour by God because
the Gypsies, being present at the Crucifixion, stole one of the
four nails, and therefore God allows them to steal, and it is not
accounted a sin to them.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the foregoing statements were not delivered
to Alma Boswell.&nbsp; Of their actual history the Anglo-Romany
folk know nothing, but this does not prevent them from holding
some curious notions about themselves.&nbsp; So, in response to
Alma&rsquo;s question about the origin of the Gypsies, I replied
that great scholars believed his race to have come from
India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think they&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; said
Alma.&nbsp; &ldquo;Far more likely we came from the land of
Bethlehem.&nbsp; Being a <i>rashai</i> (parson), you&rsquo;ll
know the Bible, I suppose, from cover to cover.&nbsp; Well,
you&rsquo;ve heard of the man called Cain.&nbsp; Now, don&rsquo;t
the Old Book say that he went away and married a black-eyed
camper-gal, one of our roving folks?&nbsp; I reckons we sprang
from them.&nbsp; We was the first people what the dear <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Lord made,
and mebbe we shall be the last on earth.&nbsp; When all the rest
is wore out, there&rsquo;ll still be a few of our folks
travelling with tents and wagons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was Alma&rsquo;s idea of the origin of the Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you must read my
Uncle Westarus&rsquo;s big book all about our people.&nbsp; There
was a doctor and a lawyer, wery kind gentlemen, real
<i>bawr&ecirc; raiaw</i> (swells), who used to talk to my uncle
for hours on end, and they wrote down every word he said, and
then he wrote them a sight of letters, wery long ones, and they
are all of &rsquo;em in print.&nbsp; So if you reads that book,
you&rsquo;ll larn all as is&rsquo; known about us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alma&rsquo;s Uncle Westarus was certainly a remarkable Gypsy,
possessing quite a library, which he carried about with him on
his travels.&nbsp; It is on record that at the age of fifty-five
his library included several volumes of fiction, history, poetry,
and science, a large Bible, a Church of England Prayer Book,
Burns&rsquo;s <i>Justice</i>, as well as English, Greek, and
Latin dictionaries.</p>
<p>For the information of those who may not already know it, the
volume designated by Alma &ldquo;my uncle&rsquo;s book&rdquo; is
a most valuable <i>vade mecum</i> for Gypsy students entitled
<i>The Dialect of the English Gypsies</i>, by Dr. Bath Smart and
Mr. H. T. Crofton.</p>
<p>There was a strong dash of Gypsy pride in Alma&rsquo;s remark
that the Boswells were the only real Gypsies left.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These others all about us are <i>kek tatsho</i>&rdquo;
(not <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>genuine), he said, with a wave of the hand;
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re only half-breeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I queried, &ldquo;are not the Herons and
Lees good Gypsies?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, veering from his first
statement, he admitted that the families I had named might be
allowed a place among the old roots.</p>
<p>Then followed a discussion about grades of Gypsy blood.&nbsp;
These were classified by Alma&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Black <i>Romanitshel</i>s, &ldquo;the real
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The <i>Didakai</i>s, or half-breeds, who pronounce
the Romany words <i>dik akai</i> (look here) as <i>did
akai</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Hedge-crawlers, or mumpers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of &rsquo;em up London way,&rdquo;
said Alma.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;d scorn to go near the likes of
them&mdash;a <i>tshikli</i> (dirty) lot, not Gypsies at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his last remark Alma certainly hit the nail on the
head.&nbsp; The distinction between the Gypsy and the mumper
cannot be too strongly emphasized.&nbsp; Anyone who has known
members of our old Gypsy families, such as the Boswells, Grays,
Herons, Lees, Lovells, Smiths, Stanleys, and Woods, will never
again make the grave error of confounding the Gypsy with the
mumper.</p>
<p>Rising from our hollow in the sand, we walked a little way
between the tents, and when Alma took the railway crossing for a
ramble in the town, I betook myself to his mother&rsquo;s
tent.&nbsp; Having just aroused from sleep, the old lady was
somewhat absent-minded, but she was quickly on the alert at
hearing my greeting in Romany.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;What gibberish is it you&rsquo;re talking, my
gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand it well enough, I&rsquo;m thinking,
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So blank was her look, so well-feigned her ignorance, that for
the nonce it seemed that after all the ancient language of the
tents was a delusion and a dream.</p>
<p>Then methought of a plan I had tried before.&nbsp; Having for
many years made a study of Gypsy pedigrees, I have often been
able to give a temporary shock to a Gypsy&rsquo;s mind by telling
him the names of his great-grandfathers and of his uncles and
aunts, paternal and maternal.&nbsp; &ldquo;How came you to know
all this, Mr. Hall?&rdquo; my Gypsy will ask.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
certainly don&rsquo;t look an old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now my turn to pretend ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not being very inquisitive, Mrs. Boswell,
I am wondering what your maiden-name may have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I won&rsquo;t tell you, and nobody in this town
knows what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that really so?&nbsp; Fancy, no one in Blackpool
knows your maiden-name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This very solemnly.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what if I can tell you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what was it, my gentleman?&rdquo; eyeing me
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are one of the Drapers&mdash;Old Israel&rsquo;s
daughter, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken&rdquo; (looking straight into
<a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>her large
eyes as though reading the information at the back of her brain),
&ldquo;and your two sisters were Rodi and Lani.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a stone figure had spoken, she could scarcely have looked
more amazed, and, quite forgetting herself, she
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Av adr&ecirc;</i>, <i>mi tshavo</i>, and <i>besh
t&#259;l&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (Come inside, my son, and sit
down).</p>
<p>Mrs. Boswell&rsquo;s manner was now so amiable, and her voice
so soft, that as she handed me cake and tea, I felt as if I had
known her all my life.&nbsp; All who have ever met a pure-bred
Gypsy will know what Romany politeness is, and how charming a
sense of the fitness of things these wanderers possess.&nbsp; As
one who has worked hard at Gypsy genealogy, I have myself often
been surprised at one thing.&nbsp; A member of the <i>kawlo
rat</i> (black blood) will betray no inquisitiveness in regard to
his tiresome interlocutor who may be a perfect stranger to
him.&nbsp; How many of us, I wonder, would care to be subjected
to such an inquisition as we sometimes inflict upon a Gypsy by
our interrogations as to his ancestry?&nbsp; Yet the Gypsy
apparently takes it all with complacence and good humour.</p>
<p>When taking mine ease behind the scenes in a Gypsy camp, it
has often amused me to observe how extremes meet.&nbsp; After
all, the tastes of the high and the low are not so very far
removed.&nbsp; If the duchess is proud of her blue blood and her
ancestral tree, so is the Gypsy of her black blood and lengthy
pedigree.&nbsp; <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>I have known &ldquo;swells&rdquo; who liked their game
so &ldquo;high&rdquo; that it almost ran into the fields again, a
taste akin to the Gypsy&rsquo;s liking for <i>mulo-mas</i>.&nbsp;
The Gypsy mother&rsquo;s love for her black cutty joins hands
with the after-dinner cigarette in my lady&rsquo;s boudoir.&nbsp;
It goes without saying that politeness is a stamp of both
extremes.</p>
<p>In the cool of the evening I wandered inland to a sequestered
camp, where Isaac and Sinfai Heron, those aristocrats of their
race, sat by their fire in an angle where two hedgerows met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We likes a bit o&rsquo; quiet, you see,&rdquo; said the
slender, gracious Sinfai, when I asked why they had pitched on a
spot so far from Blackpool&rsquo;s South Shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the <i>rai</i> one o&rsquo; the rugs to <i>besh
opr&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (sit upon), said Isaac to his grandson
Walter, who trotted off briskly to a large tent, and reappeared
with a smartly striped coverlet, which he spread for me beneath
the hedge.&nbsp; A second grandson, with a similar alacrity, set
off at Sinfai&rsquo;s bidding to find sticks for the fire.&nbsp;
The devotion of these lads to their grandparents seemed to spring
from a sense of comradery rather than reverence, and the quaint
deference paid in turn by the old people to the boys impressed me
not a little&mdash;a thing I have often observed in Romany
camps.</p>
<p>Old Isaac&rsquo;s memory carried him back to Mousehold Heath
of the long ago, and, listening to his talk, one could see the
brown tents and smoking fires amid the ling and fern.&nbsp; Among
the Gypsies reclining <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>by those fires were the Smiths, the
Maces, the Pinfolds, and the Grays&mdash;Sinfai&rsquo;s
folk&mdash;and of course some of the old Herons.&nbsp; Niabai,
Isaac&rsquo;s father, would sit mending kettles, for, like many
of the Gypsies of those days, he was a tinker by calling, and
when on travel would carry his grindstone on his back.&nbsp;
Sometimes of an evening, &ldquo;Mister Burrow&rdquo; would walk
up on to the Heath for a chat with Niabai and his wife
&ldquo;Crowy,&rdquo; so called by reason of her very dark
features.&nbsp; Borrow picked up from Crowy many a Romany
<i>lav</i> (word).&nbsp; Gypsy fights were common on the Heath,
and at times the fern would be trampled down by the crowds who
came from far and near to witness these thrilling scenes.</p>
<p>Old Isaac had two uncles of whom he made mention&mdash;William
Heron, always known as &ldquo;the handsome man,&rdquo; and Robert
Heron, known as &ldquo;the lame man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Examples of a
remarkable exactness of observation are Borrow&rsquo;s
pen-portraits of the two last-named brothers contained in the
Introduction to <i>The Zincali</i>.&nbsp; The writer does not
mention them by name, but when I submitted a memorized version of
these word-pictures to my friend Isaac he at once recognized his
uncles, William and Robert.</p>
<p>Let us open <i>The Zincali</i>.</p>
<p>Handsome William is standing by his horse.&nbsp; He is tall,
as were all the men of his clan.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Almost a giant, for his height could not
have been less than six feet three.&nbsp; It is impossible for <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>the
imagination to conceive anything more perfectly beautiful than
were the features of this man, and the most skilful sculptor of
Greece might have taken them as his model for a hero and a
god.&nbsp; The forehead was exceedingly lofty&mdash;a rare thing
in a Gypsy; the nose less Roman than Grecian&mdash;fine, yet
delicate; the eyes large, overhung with long, drooping lashes,
giving them almost a melancholy expression; it was only when the
lashes were elevated that the Gypsy glance was seen, if that can
be called a glance which is a strange stare, like nothing else in
the world.&nbsp; His complexion was a beautiful olive, and his
teeth were of a brilliance uncommon even amongst these people,
who have all fine teeth.&nbsp; He was dressed in a coarse
wagoner&rsquo;s slop, which, however, was unable to conceal
altogether his noble and Herculean figure.&nbsp; He might be
about twenty-eight.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William is said to have persisted in carrying his own silver
mug in his coat pocket, and would drink out of no other
vessel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d scorn to wet my lips with a drop
of drink out of a <i>gawjikeno kuro</i>,&rdquo; meaning the
publican&rsquo;s mugs.</p>
<p>Robert, William&rsquo;s elder brother, remained on horseback,
looking &ldquo;more like a phantom than anything human.&nbsp; His
complexion was the colour of pale dust, and of that same colour
was all that pertained to him, hat and clothes.&nbsp; His boots
were dusty of course, for it was midsummer, and his very horse
was of a dusty dun.&nbsp; His features were <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>whimsically
ugly, most of his teeth were gone, and as to age, he might be
thirty or sixty.&nbsp; He was somewhat lame and halt, but an
unequalled rider when once upon his steed, which he was naturally
not very solicitous to quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Robert was always considered the wizard of the clan.&nbsp;
Never having been married, he dispensed with a tent, preferring,
like some of the deep Woods of Wales, to sleep in a barn.&nbsp;
He was nicknamed &ldquo;Church&rdquo; Robert, because he was a
reader and had a wonderful memory, and sometimes going to church
he listened to lessons and psalms and would afterwards reel them
off like a <i>roker</i>in <i>tshiriklo</i> (parrot).</p>
<p>When I made a move to go, Old Isaac drew himself to his full
height and said, &ldquo;<i>Av akai apopli</i>,
<i>rashai</i>&rdquo; (Come here again, parson), and the boys to
whom I had mentioned my roving experiences urged me to come and
camp near them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us put up a tent for you here
next to ours.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sinfai, who walked to the field-gate
with me, slipped into my pocket a <i>bita delaben</i> (small
gift), a green wineglass.</p>
<p>A sunset of rare beauty was reddening the sandhills when I
returned to the Gypsyry on the South Shore.&nbsp; For a while I
walked up and down in the miniature fair, and before I turned my
face towards the town, lights began to appear in the tent baulks
and the stars came out over the darkening sea.</p>
<p>Next morning I was walking along the spacious <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>sea-front
with Archie Smith for companion, and in the distance appeared a
little man pushing a grinding-barrow.&nbsp; Quickening our steps,
we overtook him and found he was Elijah Heron on his morning
round.&nbsp; I inquired where he was stopping, and promised to
visit him later in the day.&nbsp; My companion, the lively
Archie, was reeling off for my benefit a list of the inhabitants
of the South Shore Gypsyry, and had just mentioned Bendigo Purum,
when, rounding a corner, we met the man himself, a very swarthy
Gypsy&mdash;almost black, one might say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Roker</i> of the <i>Beng</i>,&rdquo; whispered
Archie, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll <i>dik lesti</i>&rdquo; (see
him).</p>
<p>Farther along in a narrow thoroughfare we observed several
Gypsy women out a-shopping, their gay <i>diklo</i>s and blouses
making splashes of bright colour in the crowded street.&nbsp; It
seemed to me that Blackpool was alive with Gypsies.&nbsp; In the
afternoon I returned to the South Shore, and, hearing the strains
of a violin proceeding from a gorgeous red blanket tent in a
field near the railway, I made my way thither, and to my joy I
discovered Eros and Lias Robinson at home.</p>
<p>Here is a song which I heard from the lips of Lias&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Mandi&rsquo;s tshori puri dai</i><br />
<i>Jaw</i>&rsquo;d <i>adr&ecirc; kongri</i> to <i>shun</i> the
<i>rashai</i>;<br />
The <i>gawj&ecirc; saw sal</i>&rsquo;d as <i>yoi besh</i>&rsquo;d
<i>tal&ecirc;</i>;<br />
<i>Yoi dik</i>&rsquo;d &rsquo;<i>dr&ecirc;</i> the <i>lil</i>,
but <i>yoi keka del-apr&ecirc;</i>;<br />
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>The
<i>rashai roker</i>&rsquo;d agen <i>duker</i>in,
<i>pen</i>&rsquo;d <i>dova sos</i> a <i>laj</i>,<br />
But <i>yov keka jin</i>&rsquo;d <i>mandi duker</i>&rsquo;d
<i>yov</i>&rsquo;s <i>tshai</i>,<br />
<i>Puker</i>&rsquo;d <i>yoi</i>&rsquo;d <i>romer</i> a <i>barvdo

</blockquote>
<p><i>Translation</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My poor old mother<br />
Went into church to hear the parson;<br />
The gentiles all laughed as she sat down;<br />
She looked into the book, but she could not read;<br />
The parson talked against fortune-telling, said it was a
shame,<br />
But he never knew I had told his daughter&rsquo;s fortune,<br />
Told her she&rsquo;d marry a wealthy squire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lias was full of reminiscences of wanderings through the heart
of Wales, and I listened with keen interest to his talk about the
deep Woods.&nbsp; In my readings of Leland&rsquo;s writings I had
come upon the mention of Mat Wood whom, in after years, I had the
good fortune to meet in Wales.&nbsp; During his Welsh wanderings,
Lias had met several sons of John Roberts, the harpist,
concerning whom I had learned much from Groome&rsquo;s delightful
book, <i>In Gipsy Tents</i>.&nbsp; Here I may mention that Old
John Roberts was an occasional visitor to Lincolnshire in days
gone by.&nbsp; He travelled widely with his harp, on which he was
a talented player.&nbsp; My wife, who hails from the Fen country,
remembers John&rsquo;s visits to her native village of Fleet,
near Holbeach in Lincolnshire, where he would play on the parish
green, as well as on the lawns of private houses.&nbsp; A
venerable-looking, bearded man, who might have passed for a
clergyman, he was a welcome guest in the home of my <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>father-in-law, where he would play old airs to a
pianoforte accompaniment.</p>

<p>The afternoon and evening which followed my morning ramble
were crowded with Gypsy experiences.&nbsp; At the back of a large
tent sat Kenza Boswell fiddling, while his daughters danced with
exceeding grace.</p>
<p>Next, Noarus T&acirc;no, in one of his skittish moods, kept me
in fits of laughter for ten minutes.&nbsp; He was the humorist of
the Blackpool camp.</p>
<p>Entirely unaccustomed to controlling his imagination, Noarus
will tell an extraordinary tale in which he himself plays a part,
with no other object than to amuse his hearer, or to lift himself
a little higher in your esteem.&nbsp; And just as no one is
expected to believe the narratives of Baron Munchausen, so the
Gypsy in telling his &ldquo;lying tale&rdquo; is perfectly
content with the laughter of the listener.&nbsp; This gay spirit
of exaggeration certainly stamps the following tale told by Old

<p>The scene is the kitchen of the village inn, and
poultry-lifting is the topic of conversation.&nbsp; It is Noarus
who speaks&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a farmer&rsquo;s wife up in
the willage what&rsquo;s been blaming a two-legged fox for
robbing her hen-roost.&nbsp; I say it&rsquo;s some low dealer
what comes out of the town with a light cart on a shiny night
when the stormy winds are blowing, so as folks shan&rsquo;t hear
him at work.&nbsp; You knows the sort, but us Gypsies has a
different way.&nbsp; When did you ever know any <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>of us to
meddle with anythink in these here parts?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t your
farmers buy ponies off us?&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t we highly respected
by the gentle-folk for miles round?&nbsp; Why, there was a squire
up in Yorkshire, a prize-poultry fancier, as know&rsquo;d my
people wery well.&nbsp; We often camped on his land and never
meddled with nothink.&nbsp; He trusted us so much that he comes
down to our tents one day and says to my daddy&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want to beg a favour of you, T&acirc;no.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m going abroad for a while, and I want you and your son
to take charge of my poultry farm while I&rsquo;m
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my daddy and me took charge of his prize fowls,
and when he come back again, how do you think he found things, my
gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company, profoundly impressed by the speaker&rsquo;s
discourse, exclaimed with one voice&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right to a feather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, that he never did.&nbsp; <i>We</i>&rsquo;d <i>ate
the hull blessed lot</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mindful of my promise to visit Elijah Heron, I sought out his
tent, and I had to stoop very low to get in the doorway.&nbsp; In
my pocket was a heavy, silver-mounted brier pipe possessing a
large amber mouthpiece.&nbsp; This I presented to the old man,
and it was good to see his face light up with pleasure.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Tatsheni rup si kova</i>&rdquo; (Real silver is this),
he said, pointing to the mountings.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
<i>sw&ecirc;gler</i>&rsquo;s <i>kek kushto</i> without
<i>tuvalo</i>&rdquo; (A pipe&rsquo;s no good without tobacco), <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>I remarked,
handing him a cake of Black Jack.&nbsp; He lighted up and looked
as happy as a king.</p>
<p>Noticing that I was slightly deaf, he recommended oil
extracted from vipers as good for deafness.&nbsp; The mention of
snakes took him back to his sojourn in the Antipodes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never talks of <i>saps</i> (snakes) but I thinks of the
days when I was travelling in &rsquo;Stralia.&nbsp; One night I
got leave from a farmer to stop near a river, but I didn&rsquo;t
<i>hatsh odoi</i> (remain there) for more than an hour or two,
for I found there was <i>saps</i> about&mdash;nasty, hissing
critturs.&nbsp; A black man as come down to the river to water
some hosses told me that the <i>saps</i> sometimes
<i>maw</i>&rsquo;d (killed) animals near the river, so I packed
up my traps and kept on the road all night.&nbsp; Give me Old
England, I say.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m right glad to be back
here.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In a little tent hard by, I heard Poley and his wife singing
as I said &ldquo;Good-night&rdquo; to Elijah.&nbsp; Happy,
twinkling eyes they were that looked out at me from that little
tent door as I passed.&nbsp; I envy you that merry heart, Poley,
that evergreen spirit of yours, and, recalling your face, I see
again the array of Gypsy tents as twilight dropped its purple
veil on Blackpool&rsquo;s pleasant shore.</p>

89</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A TRENTSIDE FAIR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Overnight</span> a welcome rain had fallen
upon a thirsty land, and morning broke cool and grey, with a
lively breeze stirring the tree-tops, and shaking the raindrops
from the grasses, as I strode along the banks of the river Trent,
with my face set towards West Stockwith Horse Fair.&nbsp; The
long, dry summer was drawing to a close, and there was an
agreeable sense of novelty in the rain-drenched aspect of the
countryside.&nbsp; After a harvest prematurely ripened by an
exuberance of sunshine, brown-cheeked September was now hastening
to splash here a leaf and there a spray with rich colour, and on
this particular morning it seemed to me that reeds, flags, and
willows were taking on autumnal tints earlier than usual.&nbsp;
Occasionally, from the river bank, I spied a water-rat or a coot
swimming amongst the sedges, and once on the path stretching
before me a pert wagtail&mdash;the Gypsy bird&mdash;foretold, as
the Gypsies say, a coming encounter with roving friends.</p>
<p>Pleasantly enough my early morning walk terminated at the
old-world Trentside village of my destination.&nbsp; By this
time, between the vapours <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>rolling overhead, the sun had
appeared, and was gilding the barges moored to a primitive quay
below the long line of straggling houses.&nbsp; On the
Lincolnshire side of the Trent quite a colony of Gypsy vans had
drawn up on a turfy plateau, and their owners were now to be seen
crossing the river by ferry-boat, their laughter floating to me
over the water.&nbsp; This was by no means my first visit to the
riverside horse fair, and after refreshing at one of the inns, I
went down the lane to the fair-ground occupying two fields, in
the larger of which were already assembled horses and dealers in
a state of lively commotion beyond a fringe of ale-booths and
luncheon tents; while in the smaller field were gathered numerous
Gypsy families with their carts and smoking fires.</p>
<p>Never in my life do I remember to have witnessed such a horde
of ancient vagabonds of both sexes as on this occasion, and with
no little delight I stood and gazed upon the picture.&nbsp; What
struck me in particular was the motley character of the
party.&nbsp; Decrepit great-grandfolks mumbling together;
grandfathers in ragged garb and battered hats; wizened
grandmothers sucking their pipes; aged uncles and aunts in
time-stained tatters; wives in their teens dandling babies;
bright-eyed children drumming happily on the bottoms of inverted
pots and pans; merry lads and lasses, interspersed amongst an
assembly of the quaintest rag dolls it has ever been my fortune
to behold.&nbsp; It seemed to me as if all the old Romany <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>folk of
several counties had met together for the last time in their
lives.</p>
<p>Moving into the larger field, I had not gone far before I felt
a tug at my sleeve, and, looking round, I saw the two lads whom I
had met with Jonathan by the watermill.&nbsp; They led me
straight to a little covered cart drawn under the hedge where
Boswell was conversing with &rsquo;Plisti Smith.</p>
<p>As I have said elsewhere, the play-spirit is strong in the
Gypsy, even in his latter years, and while talking with my two
friends up came a comical-looking Gypsy, Charley Welch, who must
have been nearer ninety than seventy, and, picking up a potato
lying on the ground&mdash;the large field had grown a crop of
potatoes that summer&mdash;he laughingly dropped it into
Jonathan&rsquo;s coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t say that Old Charley never gave you
nothink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that I walked with Jonathan among the horses, and we
came upon Flash Arno and Black &Icirc;nan, who found time to
accompany us to one of the refreshment booths where the talk
ranged through a variety of topics.&nbsp; &Icirc;nan knew Mister
Groome, the book-writer, up Edinburgh way.&nbsp; He had met him
there not long before in company with my friend Frampton
Boswell.&nbsp; I soon found that these Gypsies did not hold with
folks writing books about their race and telling the <i>mumpli
gawj&ecirc;</i> (nasty gentiles) about their ways.</p>
<p>No one loves a little fun more than the Gypsy, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>and generally
he means no harm by his playful romancing.&nbsp; After all, he is
but a grown-up child, and loves to make-believe.&nbsp; The
Gypsy&rsquo;s world is a haphazard one, in which luck plays a
large part.&nbsp; He knows nothing of the orderly cosmos of
providence or science.&nbsp; I make these remarks by way of
prelude to examples of this spirit.</p>
<p>Who can help laughing inwardly as the Gypsy weaves a romantic
tale about you, all for the benefit of a stranger?&nbsp; And in
the course of my morning&rsquo;s ramble through West Stockwith
Fair I had several experiences of the kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that little dealer over there?&rdquo; said Peter
Smith, indicating a small Gypsy man holding a tall black horse by
a halter.&nbsp; The animal looked gigantic by the side of its
owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along with me, and while I <i>roker</i> (talk) to
him, <i>maw puker</i> a <i>lav</i>&rdquo; (don&rsquo;t speak a
word).&nbsp; Then we both went up to the little Gypsy, and with
the gravest of countenances Peter began to spin a long romance
all about an imaginary sister of mine who lived at Brighton and
was wanting just such a horse as the one before us.&nbsp; It
really was a fine animal, and I could not refrain from stroking
its glossy skin.</p>
<p>Peter continued: &ldquo;This here gentleman doesn&rsquo;t ride
hisself, you see, but his sister has asked him to look out for a
horse, and this one &rsquo;ull just suit her.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
found it difficult to preserve silence, but somehow I managed to
do so.&nbsp; Finally, Peter took me aside <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>and talked
mysteriously about nothing in particular, and quietly bade me
walk away.&nbsp; A few minutes later I beheld Peter quaffing a
large mug of ale evidently at the little man&rsquo;s expense.</p>
<p>Moving in and out among the throng, I presently walked out
along the road, and there I came upon Hamal&ecirc;n Smith, who,
after some talk, suggested a bit of fun.&nbsp; Pointing to a
Gypsy camp down a lane, he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Belinda Trickett sitting by the fire with
her children.&nbsp; Go you down the lane and have a little
game.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll stop here and see how you get on.&nbsp;
You don&rsquo;t know the woman, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a stranger to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; Togged as you are,
she&rsquo;ll never take you for a parson, not she.&nbsp; Mind you
look severe-like and say to Belinda, &lsquo;Is your husband at
home?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Harry,
but she&rsquo;s sure to say it&rsquo;s something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the lane I went, and, approaching Mrs. Trickett and
family, I drew out a notebook and pencil&mdash;a sure way to
frighten a Gypsy.&nbsp; Why these things should suggest
&ldquo;police&rdquo; I can scarcely say, but they do.&nbsp; The
woman&rsquo;s clay pipe dropped from her mouth and fell upon the
grass, and beneath the brown of her cheeks a pallor crept.&nbsp;
Mrs. Trickett was alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your husband&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will he be at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s gone to the
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under their mother&rsquo;s shawl three tiny children huddled
like little brown partridges beneath an outspread wing, a sight
which caused me some pricking of heart.&nbsp; The biggest child
kept saying, &ldquo;What does the <i>gawjo</i> want,
mammy?&rdquo;&nbsp; Just then I looked up the lane and saw a man
coming down, who by his jaunty air I guessed was the
woman&rsquo;s husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Kushti sawla</i> (Good morning), Mr. Trickett; take
a little <i>tuvalo</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; I handed him my tobacco
pouch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come a long way to see you.&nbsp;
Ask me to sit down a bit, now I&rsquo;ve got here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Trickett&rsquo;s face was a study in wonderment, as I sat
down for a friendly chat.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Dawdi</i>,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;you did <i>trasher mandi</i> (frighten me).&nbsp; I
thought there was <i>tshumani opr&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (something
up).</p>
<p>When Hamal&ecirc;n Smith, from the top of the lane, saw that
the episode had arrived at a happy termination, he strolled down
the lane and joined us.</p>
<p>A far-travelled Gypsy is Hamal&ecirc;n, and many a tale can he
unfold.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One morning,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a
policeman came up to my wagon and told me as how twenty-four
fowls was missing from the next field to where we was
stopping.&nbsp; Somebody had stole &rsquo;em in the night.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Of course you suspects us,&rsquo; says I to the policeman,
&lsquo;but you&rsquo;re wrong.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve never touched a
feather of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;&nbsp; However, nothing would do but
the man <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>must search my wagon from top to bottom, and for all his
trouble he found nothing.&nbsp; I know&rsquo;d very well I
hadn&rsquo;t touched &rsquo;em, and I was telling him the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see <i>three</i> vans in this field last
night as I was going along the high road?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;My boys have
gone on in front with the other wagons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Says he, &lsquo;That looks suspicious.&nbsp; I must
make haste and find them.&nbsp; Where have they gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say, for I don&rsquo;t know
myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I shall have to come with you, and you
must show me where to find them.&rsquo;&nbsp; The policeman
jumped up and sat on the seat along with me and my wife, and off
we went to find the boys.&nbsp; Of course it was plain to see by
the wheel-marks just outside the gate which way they had turned,
but when we got to the cross-roads about three miles furder on,
the road was that hard and dry that no wheel-marks could be
seen.&nbsp; Now I could easily have misled the policeman, but I
thought it best to try to find the boys as quick as I could, for
I didn&rsquo;t believe for a minute they had done it.&nbsp;
Looking down the road, I saw the boys&rsquo; <i>patrin</i>
(guiding sign).&nbsp; The policeman didn&rsquo;t know what I was
looking at, and it wasn&rsquo;t likely as I should show him our
signs, so I says we&rsquo;ll take this road, and we turned off to
the left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How did you know which way the boys had
gone?&rsquo; asked the policeman.&nbsp; &lsquo;Was it some <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>thing tied on
that tree bough hanging over the road?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I never sees nothing on the tree bough,&rsquo;
says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought to myself the policeman must have been
reading some tale about the Gypsies.&nbsp; Anyway, he had heard
something about <i>patrin</i>s and such-like, but I wasn&rsquo;t
going to be the one to larn him our signs, so I changed the
subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yon&rsquo;s my boys on in front,&rsquo; says
I.&nbsp; The policeman began rubbing his hands and smiling.&nbsp;
At last we caught up with the boys, and the policeman searched
inside the two wagons and found nothing.&nbsp; Then he
says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I might as well look on the top,&rsquo; and he
climbed on to the roofs of the wagons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hello, what have we here?&rsquo; says he, in a
way that made me turn warm.&nbsp; He lifted up a dead pigeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where did you get that from?&rsquo; I asked the
boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Picked it up a bit o&rsquo; way down the
road.&nbsp; It had just killed itself on the telegraph wires by
the wood side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, the disappointed policeman went away, and
the thieves were never found out.</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Another time we draw&rsquo;d into a rutted
lane lying off the high road.&nbsp; We had our three wagons, and
at night we always covered the big one up, because <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>we
didn&rsquo;t sleep in it.&nbsp; It was a nice quiet lane, and we
thought there would be nobody to trouble us as there was no
willage near.&nbsp; But about midnight a man knocked on the wagon
and woke us up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you doing here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No harm, I hope.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll clear out
first thing in the morning.&rsquo;&nbsp; He said he&rsquo;d been
knocking at the big wagon what was covered up, and he
couldn&rsquo;t make anybody hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;whatever you do,
don&rsquo;t you touch that big wagon agen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s in it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wild beasts, for sure&mdash;<i>a lion and a
tiger</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; laughed at the way that man made
hisself scarce.&nbsp; Next morning, as we draw&rsquo;d out of the
lane, we met a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hear you have some wild beasts in that big
wagon of yours.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t it a bit dangerous stopping so
near the highway?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, we&rsquo;re clearing out in good
time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get along with you then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few miles furder on the road we come to a little
town, and as it was market day we pulled up in the big square,
and I took the cover off the big wagon.&nbsp; Just as I was doing
this, who should come up but the policeman we&rsquo;d met in the
early morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s those wild beasts of yours?&rsquo;
says he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon show
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; And I went inside my brush and carpet wagon and
brought out <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>two big rugs, and I showed him a tiger skin and a lion
skin, both lined with red.&nbsp; &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my wild
beasts,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk about laughing, I thought that policeman would
never ha&rsquo; stopped.&rdquo;</p>

99</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TAKEN FOR TRAMPS&mdash;AN EAST ANGLIAN
FAMILY</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> after day, in the woods around
our village, the autumnal gales roared and ravened with unabated
fury, snapping brittle boughs, cracking decrepit boles, and
piling up drifts of brown leaves around grey roots protruding
like half-buried bones through the mossy woodland floor.&nbsp;
Then right in the midst of it all came a spell of calm weather,
as if summer had stolen back to her former haunts in sylvan glade
and ferny lane.&nbsp; Call it by what name you please, this brief
season of sunny repose following upon the heels of the
tempestuous equinoctials is a time when some of us are impelled,
as by a primal instinct, to shake off the collar of routine and
take the road leading over the hill into what realm of adventure
beyond.</p>
<p>Fully a week the summer-like interlude had held sway in the
land.&nbsp; Upon the newly-turned furrows shimmered a golden
light.&nbsp; A dreamy haze trailed its filmy skirts over hill and
dale.&nbsp; In narrow lanes invisible threads of spiders&rsquo;
silk stretched from hedge to hedge, and wayside tangles again
were silvered over with a fine dust suggestive of July.&nbsp;
Amid the <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>lingering clover-flowers bees buzzed and
blundered.&nbsp; Through the still air, leaves of maple and
chestnut, like red-winged insects, twirled down to the grass, and
the tall elms in the village churchyard littered their yellow
foliage upon the graves.&nbsp; Everywhere, serenitude, repose,
peace, save in restless hearts chafing at the humdrum of tasks
grown monotonous by reason of long-continued performance.&nbsp;
For who with a soul fully awake can resist the lure of the road
at gossamer-time?</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass one afternoon that my wife and I,
slipping out of our drowsy village, took the upland way which
after numerous windings brought us into the Great North
Road.&nbsp; Our plans were of the flimsiest.&nbsp; It mattered
little whether we went north or south, so long as we were absent
for a few days.&nbsp; On reaching the far-famed highway we stood
under the branching arms of a finger-post, and tossed pennies to
determine the course of our itinerary.&nbsp; &ldquo;North&rdquo;
having won the toss, we footed it gaily in that direction.&nbsp;
To be sure, our semi-Gypsy garb, donned for this jaunt, was not
long in taking on a coating of road dust, and we were about to
shake off this clinging powder, when the rattle of wheels was
heard behind us, and almost immediately a dogcart slowed down by
our side, and the driver, a rubicund farmer, amicably invited us
to take a lift, an offer which was gladly accepted, and we
climbed aboard the conveyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve allus had a feeling for folks like you, and
<a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>I offens
give &rsquo;em a lift as I&rsquo;m passing back&rsquo;ards and
forrards on the ramper.&nbsp; Afore I pulled up just now I says
to myself, &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve seen better days, I&rsquo;ll be
bound.&rsquo;&nbsp; Maybe you&rsquo;ve been in the army?&nbsp;
Leastways, I thought you seemed to hold yourself up pretty
straight in your walk.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve done a bit of soldiering
myself.&nbsp; Once at a big do-ment in London, I was in the
Queen&rsquo;s Escort.&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;ve been about a bit in
my time.&nbsp; I dessay you two&rsquo;s got a goodish way to go
yet afore you come to your night&rsquo;s lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, dear me,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we offens has
your sort calling at our place&mdash;my farm&rsquo;s a few miles
farther along this way&mdash;and one day not long since a poor
chap knocked at our door and asked for work.&nbsp; He was a
parson&rsquo;s son, so we gave him a lightish job and fed him
well and bedded him in the barn for three or four nights, till
his sore feet got right agen.&nbsp; Poor fellow, he worn&rsquo;t
much good at labouring work, but we liked to listen to his tales;
he could tell you summut now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he rambled on after the manner of a garrulous Guardian of
the Poor who had acquired an interest in tramps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yon&rsquo;s my place among the trees, so I must leave
you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thanked him for his kindly lift, and, rounding a bend in
the highway, were glad to relieve our pent-up feelings in
laughter over the good man&rsquo;s misconception.</p>
<p>Now, as everyone knows, who has journeyed <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>along it,
the fine old turnpike abounds in travellers of every shade and
grade.&nbsp; Not once or twice on its turfy wayside have I
fraternized with &ldquo;Weary Willies&rdquo; boiling their tea in
discarded treacle-tins.&nbsp; Even now as we went along, two or
three tramps passed by, one of them coming up to beg a few
matches, the others scarcely giving us a glance.</p>
<p>Hearing the rumble of an approaching vehicle, we looked
towards the bend of the road, and round it came what looked like
a carrier&rsquo;s cart drawn by a horse apparently old, for it
proceeded slowly, and the cart creaked and jolted as if it, too,
were ancient.&nbsp; As it jogged nearer, I saw it contained but a
single occupant&mdash;a brown-faced little man who wore a faded
yellow kerchief&mdash;and, stepping into the roadway, I greeted
him with <i>s&acirc; shan</i> (how do?).&nbsp; Whereupon he
pulled up.&nbsp; &ldquo;I heard what you said just now, but
you&rsquo;ve made a mistake.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no
Romany&mdash;I&rsquo;m a showman, an Aunt Sally man, bound for
Retford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now a Gypsy will frequently deny his blood.&nbsp; Knowing that
his kind live under a ban, he has no desire to draw attention to
himself.&nbsp; But, looking at this Aunt Sally man, I saw that he
had told the truth.&nbsp; His face was freckled.&nbsp; No real
Gypsy freckles.&nbsp; After all, as Groome says, &ldquo;It is not
the caravan that makes the Gypsy, any more than my cat becomes a
dog if she takes to living in a kennel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our road now became a gradual descent into a clean,
flower-loving village, where amid the trees we caught the gleam
of a large canvas booth in a field, <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>and there were knockings of a mallet
to be heard.&nbsp; Nor was it long before we learned what was
afoot.&nbsp; Within a tavern&rsquo;s comfortable parlour, a
coloured playbill informed the world that Harrison&rsquo;s
travelling theatre would that evening present a sensational
drama&mdash;<i>Gypsy Jack</i>&mdash;and in due time we found
ourselves seated among the cottagers and farm-hands, enjoying a
highly entertaining, though garbled, version of Mr. G. R.
Sims&rsquo;s <i>Romany Rye</i>.&nbsp; Opening with a Gypsy
encampment in which the gaily dressed Lees sat talking round a
fire in a forest glade, we were successively shown Joe
Hackett&rsquo;s shop, the race-course at Epsom, the deck of the
<i>Saratoga</i>, the cellar near Rotherhithe, and the Thames by
night.&nbsp; The play seemed a not inappropriate episode in our
Gypsy jaunt.</p>
<p>Years afterwards, during one Derby week, I saw Mr.
Sims&rsquo;s <i>Romany Rye</i> remarkably well played at a South
London theatre.&nbsp; In connection with this play an amusing
story is told.&nbsp; The managers of the Princess&rsquo;s Theatre
in London were anxious that the new drama should be announced in
the &ldquo;Agony&rdquo; column of <i>The Times</i>.&nbsp; Like
many another one, the advertisement clerk at <i>The Times</i>
office could make nothing whatever of the mysterious words
<i>Romany Rye</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is this <i>Romany Rye</i>?&rdquo; he
asked the bearer of the strange document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, sir,&rdquo; said the messenger, whom the
manager of the theatre had sworn to secrecy&mdash;&ldquo;if <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>you please,
sir, I think it&rsquo;s the name of a new liver-pad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the official, &ldquo;<i>The
Times</i> is a great paper and can do without padding.&nbsp; Take
it away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the door of the canvas theatre it was an easy walk to the
little town of Newark-on-Trent, at one of whose pleasant
hostelries we spent the night, our window overlooking the ruined
castle by the waterside.&nbsp; It had been in our minds to
continue our walk next morning along the Great North Road, but at
breakfast a small paragraph in a newspaper brought about a quick
change in our plans.&nbsp; The item of news ran thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>THE ROMANIES
AGAIN</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friends, the gipsy Greys, are still with us in
Grimsby, lamented Mr. Councillor E&mdash; last evening, and he
wanted to know whether something could not be done to get them to
clear out.&nbsp; The Town Clerk had assisted them somewhat, and
one or two had gone, but there were still four families encamped
at the back of T&mdash; Street, New Clee.&nbsp; Inspector
M&mdash; said he had visited the encampment and he must say that
the caravans were very clean.&nbsp; They could not be said to
create a nuisance.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is not the tents that are a
nuisance,&rsquo; replied the lively representative of the
H&mdash; Ward, &lsquo;but the parties <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>themselves, who trespass in the
backyards of the houses in that neighbourhood.&nbsp; It is no
uncommon thing on waking up in the morning to find a donkey or a
goat in your backyard or garden.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Inspector
stated that Eliza Grey, the owner of the vans, had informed him
they would all be going away in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the sight of the Romany family name which altered our
plans.&nbsp; The East Anglian Grays are a good type of Gypsy not
to be encountered every day, hence we decided to lose no time in
taking the train for Grimsby.&nbsp; It was a crawling
&ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; by which we travelled, and at a little
wayside station a few miles out of Newark, a lithe, dark fellow
carrying a pedlar&rsquo;s basket stepped into our compartment,
and at once I recognized in him my old friend Snakey
Petulengro.&nbsp; How his face lit up on seeing me, for we had
not met for years.&nbsp; I was so much struck by his altered
bearing that I could scarcely believe my eyes.&nbsp; He seemed
now as gentle in his manner as once he had been wild.&nbsp; The
sight of him brought back Gypsy Court and all its
associations.&nbsp; He said he had left the old home, his father
and mother having passed away.&nbsp; On my inquiring about his
sister Sibby, he said she had married a Gypsy and, tiring of Old
England, had gone to &rsquo;Merikay.&nbsp; As Snakey quitted the
carriage at Lincoln, an observant passenger remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There goes one of Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon the slender hydraulic tower <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>glowed
rosily in the sunlight above Grimsby Docks; and since the
fishing-port had no particular charm for us, we proceeded to
Cleethorpes, preferring the more airy shore and being eager to
see the Gypsies.&nbsp; As might be expected, the summer-like day
had brought a goodly number of late holiday-makers to the sands,
and as we moved in and out among the groups near the pier foot, I
heard a donkey-boy address someone not far away&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would the lady like a ride?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
lad&rsquo;s features, bearing, and tone of voice were distinctly
Gypsy, and, seeing he was within hail, I looked towards him and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dova s&icirc; kushto maila odoi</i>&rdquo;
(That&rsquo;s a good donkey there).</p>
<p>His face beamed with delight, and from his lips sprang the
question&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Romano Rai</i>?&rdquo; (Gypsy gentleman?)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;wa</i>; <i>kai shan t&icirc;ro foki
hatsh</i>in?&rdquo; (Yes; where are your people camping?)</p>
<p>In gratitude for the explicit directions he gave, I placed a
sixpence in his hand, and his remark was
&ldquo;<i>Dova</i>&rsquo;s too <i>kisi</i>, <i>raia</i>&rdquo;
(That&rsquo;s too much, sir).&nbsp; &ldquo;A <i>hora</i> (penny)
would have been <i>dosta</i> (enough) for <i>mandi</i>&rdquo;
(me).&nbsp; This boy was one of the Grays, and, following his
instructions, we had no difficulty in locating the Romany
camp.</p>
<p>It was early evening when we strolled forth upon an expanse of
grass parcelled into building plots, where in a corner between
the hedgerows were <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>drawn up, with the doorways facing south, several
substantial <i>v&acirc;d&ecirc;</i> (caravans) near which some
large tents had been erected.&nbsp; The Grays, who were silently
moving to and fro, revealed by their interested side-glances that
they had already heard of somebody&rsquo;s inquiries concerning
themselves, and when we advanced to offer our civil and friendly
greetings to two women who were washing pots before an outside
fire, every politeness was shown to us.&nbsp; They rose and
spread a horse-rug for us upon the ground.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Dai ta
tshai</i>&rdquo; (mother and daughter), thought I; nor was I
wrong.&nbsp; The older woman, diminutive, lean, and somewhat bent
with age, informed me that she was Eliza Gray, and the younger
was her daughter Lena.&nbsp; As we talked by the fire, a goat
appeared and rubbed its nose affectionately against Eliza&rsquo;s
knee.&nbsp; Said she: &ldquo;This is an old pet of ours.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;s had it for years.&nbsp; I picked it up in
Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In late September the sun goes down early, and a chilly wind
now set in from the North Sea.&nbsp; In the baulk of the old
lady&rsquo;s tent a coke brazier was glowing invitingly, so we
all moved under cover, and, seated on a dais of clean straw
covered with rugs, listened to tales and talk, the
brazier&rsquo;s crimson gleam being our only light.&nbsp; After
some discussion of mutual acquaintances, the conversation drifted
towards <i>duker</i>in (fortune-telling), a subject never very
far from the thoughts of a Gypsy woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I&rsquo;ve <i>sal</i>&rsquo;d&rdquo; (laughed),
said Eliza, &ldquo;at those <i>dinel&ecirc; gawj&ecirc;</i>
(foolish gentiles) what come to our tent <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>to be
<i>duker</i>&rsquo;d.&nbsp; One time I put a crystal on a little
table covered with oilcloth, and I ax&rsquo;d the young lady if
she couldn&rsquo;t see her sweetheart in it.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, I
can,&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;and it&rsquo;s just like his face,
but oh, lor, in this glass ball he&rsquo;s got a
tail.&rsquo;&nbsp; I nearly laughed straight out, for I&rsquo;d
sort of accidentally put the crystal on top of a monkey
picture.&nbsp; The oilcloth was covered with all sorts of
beastses, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A superstitious family, the Grays have a characteristic way of
recounting their own traditions.&nbsp; Here is one of
Eliza&rsquo;s tales&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Once we were stopping by a woodside.&nbsp;
The back of our tent was nigh agen a dry ditch full of dead
leaves, and one night we lay abed listening to sounds, a thing I
can&rsquo;t abide.&nbsp; Well, there was rummy folk about in them
days, so when we hears a footstep in the wood just t&rsquo;other
side of that there ditch, I ups wi&rsquo; the kettle-prop and
peeps outen the tent, and listens, but no, never a sound could I
catch; all was still as the grave.&nbsp; Till long and by last
there comes a rustling in the leaves, and the bushes parts like
something trying to make a way through.&nbsp; Then I lifts up the
kettle-prop, and I says to myself, if blows are to be struck,
Liza had better be the first to strike, when there, straight
afore me, stands a woman waving her poor thin arms about, but
saying nothing.&nbsp; At that I drops the kettle-prop and
screams, and my man Perun jumps straight up.&nbsp;
&lsquo;They&rsquo;re killing my Liza, they are.&rsquo;&nbsp; But
by that <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>the <i>muli</i> (ghost) had gone like a flash of
lightning.&nbsp; Next morning we ax&rsquo;d at the keeper&rsquo;s
house down the lane, and the missis tell&rsquo;d us as how a
<i>rawni</i> (lady) was once <i>maw</i>&rsquo;d (murdered) in
that wood, so it would be her <i>muli</i> as I saw that
night.&nbsp; Oh, yes, I believe in <i>mul&ecirc;</i>, I
do.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the telling of this tale two of Eliza&rsquo;s sons,
Yoben and Poley, sauntered up and stood listening behind their
sister Lena.&nbsp; It was Yoben who now added his contribution of
ghost-lore.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Why, yes, of course, mother, there&rsquo;s
<i>mul&ecirc;</i> (ghosts).&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember after
Dolferus died, his voice used to speak in the tent to
Delaia?&nbsp; She says it really was his voice as nat&rsquo;ral
as life, and it made her shiver to hear it.&nbsp; One day she
went to a parson for advice.&nbsp; He told her the next time it
spoke, to say: &lsquo;I promise you nothing.&nbsp;
Begone!&rsquo;&nbsp; Well, sure enough, the voice came again, and
she remembered to say what the parson had told her, and she never
heard the voice no more.&nbsp; My Uncle Ike asked Delaia one
day&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I say, my gal, did you really hear
Dolferus&rsquo;s voice?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; it was his and no one
else&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is that the <i>tatshipen</i> (truth), my
gal?&rsquo;&nbsp; Ike seemed anxious to know the truth of the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dreams is funny things,&rdquo; put in
Poley, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve had some wery queer &rsquo;uns in my
time.&nbsp; Once <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>I dreamt I was walking along a narrow shelf of rock,
and on one side of me was a stony wall like a cliff, and on the
other side the edge of the path hung over a terrible steep
place.&nbsp; Right away below was a river of fiery red stuff
pouring along.&nbsp; You could smell it.&nbsp; I thought this
rocky road was the path to heaven, and I was trying to get there,
but, &rsquo;pon my word, it was no easy matter.&nbsp; Now I
see&rsquo;d a tiger chained to the rocky wall on my left hand,
and a bit furder on a big lion was tied up.&nbsp; These here
critturs was hard to get past.&nbsp; I had to go wery near the
dangerous edge what looked down on to the burning river.&nbsp;
What a fright I was in; it made the sweat run off me.&nbsp;
Sometimes I had to crawl on my hands and knees to get round a big
rock in the middle of the path.&nbsp; I felt as if I never should
get where I wanted to.&nbsp; Well, after a lot of scrambling and
slithering, for my feet gave way sometimes&mdash;I had naily
boots on&mdash;I got to the top of the path, and in the dazzling
light, like the sun itself on a summer day, there sat a
grey-haired, doubled-up man, a wery aged man, with his chin
resting on his hand.&nbsp; It was the <i>Duvel</i> (God), and
when he see&rsquo;d me coming, he sat up and held up his hand,
forbidding me to go any furder.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t speak a
word, but I knew that his uplifted hand meant &lsquo;Go
back.&rsquo;&nbsp; And just then I woke.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s my
dream of trying to get to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot about heaven and hell
in God&rsquo;s <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Book, isn&rsquo;t there, <i>rashai</i>?&rdquo; said Old
Eliza.&nbsp; &ldquo;A <i>rawni</i> (lady) used to read all about
them places to us on a Sunday, but that were years ago, and I
used to like to hear her talk about the blessed Saviour riding on
a <i>maila</i> (donkey) into the big town.&nbsp; She said they
nailed him to a cross on Good Friday, and when we was young I
remember we all used to fast on that day.&nbsp; We ate no
flesh&mdash;nothing with blood in it&mdash;it would be a sin to
do that.&nbsp; If we took anything to stay our hunger it was
nothing but dry bread, and our drink was water.&nbsp; We
didn&rsquo;t <i>tuv</i> (smoke), and we didn&rsquo;t <i>tov</i>
our <i>koker&ecirc;</i> (wash ourselves) on that day.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know whether there be such places as heaven and
hell.&nbsp; I reckons we makes our own destiny.&nbsp; Heaven and
hell&rsquo;s inside us; that&rsquo;s what I think.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lena, however, had her own ideas.&nbsp; &ldquo;This life is
everything there is, I reckons, and when we&rsquo;re dead,
that&rsquo;s the end of us.&nbsp; Life is sweet, mind you, and
we&rsquo;s a right to be as happy as we can.&nbsp; Mother&rsquo;s
getting old, you see, and has had her fling.&nbsp; I mean to have
a good time.&nbsp; Why, last Sunday me and Poley was going off to
get some nuts in the woods, but mother stopped us&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s <i>Beng</i>&rsquo;s work getting nuts on the
dear Lord&rsquo;s day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; says Yoben; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard our old
daddy say that the <i>Beng</i> likes nuts, and I&rsquo;d sartinly
scorn to go getting them onlucky things on a Sunday; I <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>wouldn&rsquo;t like to put myself in the
<i>Beng</i>&rsquo;s power, like poor Zuba Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Zuba?&rdquo; asked my wife.</p>
<p>Then Yoben told a weird tale.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p112b.jpg">
<img alt=
"A Maid of the Tents"
title=
"A Maid of the Tents"
src="images/p112s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A handsome lass was Zuba, but bad luck
dogged her like her own shadow.&nbsp; One night she came back to
the camp, for she lived with her old people, and, throwing down a
few coppers she had in her hand, she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There, mother, what do you think of that for a
hard day&rsquo;s work?&rsquo;&nbsp; She had done wery badly, you
see.&nbsp; Luck never seemed to come her way at all.&nbsp; And
after supper she wandered out a little way from the camp.&nbsp;
The moon and stars was shining as she walked round and round an
old tree, a blasted old stump, black as a gallows-post.&nbsp; As
she kept on walking round it, she said aloud, &lsquo;This game
won&rsquo;t do for me.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s money I want and money
I&rsquo;ll have.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sell my blood to the <i>Beng</i>
to have plenty of money in my pocket always.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
words was hardly out of her mouth when a black thing, like the
shadow of the tree, rose up from the ground, and, lor, there was
the wery <i>Beng</i> hisself, and after he&rsquo;d promised her
what she had wished for, he wanished.&nbsp; And after that no
more grumbling from Zuba; no more complaints about her bad
luck.&nbsp; She always had plenty of money now, and she bought
herself trinkets and fine clothes till everybody was &rsquo;mazed
at her, and of course she had kept it to herself what took place
that night by the <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>old tree.&nbsp; Days and weeks went by, till one night
Zuba was missing from the camp.&nbsp; Her old folks sat up by the
fire waiting for her, but no Zuba came.&nbsp; At last her daddy
set out to look for her, and there by the foot of the tree lay
Zuba&rsquo;s frock and shawl, and when he took &rsquo;em back to
his wife&rsquo;s tent, the poor woman screamed and fainted right
away, and old man Lovell walked up and down all night, saying,
&lsquo;Oh, my Zuba, my blessed gal, we shall never see you no
more,&rsquo; and they never did.&nbsp; The <i>Beng</i> had
fetched her.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the end of Zuba
Lovell.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While listening to these tales in the tent, the flight of the
hours passed unobserved, till a distant clock boomed out the hour
of ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll <i>wel apopli</i> (come again), my
dears?&rdquo; said Eliza, as we retired amid the smiles and bows
of the Gypsy family.</p>
<p>Next morning found us again in the camp.&nbsp; Already the
Gypsies had breakfasted, and were making preparations for
&ldquo;<i>tov</i>in-<i>divus</i>&rdquo; (washing-day).&nbsp; Sun
and wind promised an ideal day for such a purpose.&nbsp; It was a
thing to be noticed that the articles about to be dealt with lay
in two heaps on the grass.</p>
<p>Among the Gypsies there is a ceremonial rule which holds it to
be <i>mokadi</i> (unclean) to wash together in the same vessel
&ldquo;what you eat off with what you wear.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
the meaning of the separated articles, and then I observed two
zinc vessels lying <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>ready on the ground.&nbsp; Said Old Eliza to Lena,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take this lot, and you take that
lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; To begin with, they both cleansed their hands
and arms in hot water, and as they did this I remarked how brown
were Lena&rsquo;s arms, whereupon she replied with a
laugh&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;wa</i>, <i>raia</i> (Yes, sir), monkey soap
won&rsquo;t fetch that off&rdquo;&mdash;a modern rendering, I
take it, of Ferdousi&rsquo;s saying, &ldquo;No washing will turn
a Gypsy white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now as our friends were about to become much occupied, we
proposed to stroll round the camp and pay calls on the other
Gypsies in the same field.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; said
Eliza, and, slipping into the tent, she came out with a black
bottle.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take a drop of my elderberry
wine and a bite o&rsquo; cake,&rdquo; pouring out the
claret-coloured liquid into two glasses fished out from an inner
recess.&nbsp; While enjoying this snack on the grass, I took out
from a breast pocket a white unused handkerchief which I spread
on my knee.&nbsp; Presently Old Eliza slyly took it by the corner
and twitched it away, giving me in place thereof a neatly folded
napkin brought from the tent, and I saw that I had broken a Gypsy
custom in converting a handkerchief into a crumbcloth.&nbsp; Said
the old mother, &ldquo;That <i>mol</i> (wine) is old, and should
be <i>kushto</i> (good).&nbsp; It&rsquo;s some we buried in a
place till we came round again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another corner of the field were encamped Fennix Boswell
and his stepson Shanny, and, going forward, we found the pair
seated at their tent door <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>handling fishing-rods.&nbsp; On
seeing us they rose and invited us into the tent, where we sat
down.&nbsp; Shanny showed us some of his pencil drawings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got one of a parrot somewhere; I must find
it,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;wali</i>, <i>muk man dik o
roker</i>in-<i>tshiriklo</i>&rdquo; (Yes, let me see the
talking-bird), I replied, and in a minute or two he handed me a
really clever sketch.</p>
<p>These two Gypsies had just come down from Scotland, where they
had been travelling during the summer months, and we got talking
about Kirk Yetholm.&nbsp; The Blythes, related to old King
Charley Faa, were acquaintances of theirs.&nbsp; It appears that
one of the King&rsquo;s sons named Robert, a rollicking fellow,
was fond, as Gypsies are, of practical jokes, and some of his
escapades are still remembered in the Border Country.&nbsp; One
of Fennix&rsquo;s tales about this fun-loving Faa may well find a
place here.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One spring morning Bobbie started off on a foray with some of
his pals.&nbsp; The air was clear, and a soft wind was blowing
over the Lammer-moors on whose slopes the lambs were
gambolling.&nbsp; The Gypsies had walked a few miles, and the
mountain air had sharpened the edge of their appetites.&nbsp;
Looking round for a farmhouse or a cottage where they might ask
for a kettle of boiling water to brew their tea in the
can&mdash;such as few of the Faas would ever travel
without&mdash;Bobbie was the first to espy some outbuildings, at
the back of <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>which stood a shepherd&rsquo;s cottage, and, taking
upon himself to be spokesman, he bravely started off for the
cottage, the men resting meanwhile at the foot of the hill.&nbsp;
As he approached the door, a fine savoury smell greeted Bobbie,
making him feel ten times more hungry than before.&nbsp; He
knocked gently at the door, which stood ajar, but no one came,
and all was quiet within.&nbsp; He repeated his knock, and,
taking a step forward, found the kitchen empty.&nbsp; Before the
fire stood a tempting shepherds-pie of a most extraordinary size,
and its appetizing steam quite overcame any scruples which
otherwise might have lurked in the heart of Bobbie Faa.&nbsp; Not
for one moment did he hesitate, but, nipping up the dish, he
speedily ran down the hill with the pie under his arm.&nbsp; Not
knowing how he had come by it, his mates could scarcely believe
their eyes when he laid the pie on the grass, and they praised
the gude-wife who had so kindly given them such a feast.&nbsp;
When the dish was empty, he gave it to a pal, telling him to take
it back to the gude woman and say how much they had enjoyed the
pie.&nbsp; It happened to be a sheep-shearing day, and the
shepherd&rsquo;s wife had gone to call her husband and his
fellows to their dinner.&nbsp; She had just returned to the
kitchen when the Gypsy lad arrived with the empty dish, and on
handing it back to her with smiles and thanks, a torrent of abuse
was poured forth on the poor boy&rsquo;s head, as the woman now
grasped the situation and <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>became aware of the fate of her
pie.&nbsp; Just then her husband and the other shearers appeared
round the corner, and, hearing what had befallen their dinner,
the infuriated men seized the lad and gave him a sound
drubbing.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">PETERBOROUGH FAIR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> twentieth century has witnessed
a remarkable revival of certain old-time pleasures in the form of
pageants and pastoral plays, folk-songs, and dances, but it
should not be overlooked that in our midst still linger those
popular revels, tattered survivals of medieval mirth, called
pleasure-fairs, held periodically in most of our old country
towns.&nbsp; It is true, these ancient fairs are not what they
were, Father Time having laid his hand heavily upon them, with
the result that not a few of their features which were reckoned
among our childhood&rsquo;s joys have vanished.</p>

<p>Gone are the marionettes, the wax-works, the
ghost-shows.&nbsp; Departed, too, are many of the mysterious
little booths, behind whose canvas walls queer freaks and
abnormalities were wont to hide.&nbsp; Perhaps, however, when the
travelling cinema has outworn its vogue, the older
&ldquo;mystery&rdquo; shows will reappear by the side of the
Alpine slide, the scenic railway, and the joy wheel.</p>
<p>Still renowned for their wondrous gaiety are a few of our
larger fairs, whither huge crowds flock <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>by road and
rail for a few hours of rollicking carnival.&nbsp; I have in mind
such events as Barnet September Fair, Birmingham Onion Fair, the
October merry-makings at Hull, Nottingham Goose Fair, and the
like, but even these, owing to a variety of reasons, are now of
shrunken dimensions.</p>
<p>Fairs of whatever sort are generally occasions of friendly
reunion, not only for show-people and <i>gawj&ecirc;</i>
visitors, but also for Gypsies who love to forgather on the
margins of the fair-ground, or upon an adjacent common, where
they compare notes and discuss the happenings since their last
meeting.</p>
<p>Borne on the crisp October air, the chimes of Peterborough
floated over the city roofs, reaching even to the fair-grounds,
where I was one of the large holiday crowd which hustled and
laughed and tossed confetti in mimic snow-showers.&nbsp; When in
quest of Gypsies, the first half-hour you spend in wandering
about a fair is a time of pleasurable excitement.&nbsp; Who can
tell how many old friends you may meet, or what fresh dark faces
you are about to encounter?</p>
<p>As I was saying, the crowd was hilarious, and, having so far
recognized no Romany countenance up and down the footways between
the coco-nut shies and shooting-galleries, swing-boats and
merry-go-rounds, it occurred to me that a little more
breathing-space might be found upon the open pasture where horses
were being bought and sold, and, pushing along <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>in that
direction, I was brought to a standstill at the foot of the steps
leading down from a gilded show-front.&nbsp; Walking with the
airs of a fine lady, there came down those steps a young Gypsy
attired in a yellow gown and tartan blouse, with a blazing red
scarf thrown over her shoulders upon which her hair fell in black
curls.&nbsp; It was this coloured vision as much as the block in
the footway that held me up for the nonce.&nbsp; Another moment,
and Lena Gray, Old Eliza&rsquo;s daughter, brushed against my
shoulder, yet, as often happens in a crowd, she failed to see
me.&nbsp; Therefore, into her ear I dropped a whispered Romany
phrase at which she started, and, recognizing me,
exclaimed&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dawdi</i>, <i>raia</i>, this <i>is</i> a
surprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was but a few steps to the sheltered spot in a field
opposite the horse-fair where her brother Yoben sat fiddling by
the side of the living-van.&nbsp; Even before we came up to him,
something arrested my attention&mdash;the unusual shape of his
violin, which, as Lena informed me, her brother had made out of a
cigar-box picked up in a public-house.</p>
<p>Our field corner had a most agreeable outlook.&nbsp; Beyond a
stretch of greenest turf, dotted with caravans and bounded by the
reddening autumn hedgerows, lay the pleasure-fair, a sunlit
fantasia of colour, from which, like feathery plumes, ascended
puffs of white steam topping numerous whirling roundabouts.&nbsp;
Pleasant it was to sit out here in the calm weather chatting with
the Grays, whom I had <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>so recently met on the Lincolnshire
sea-border, and even while we conversed there passed by a little
party of gaily-dressed Gypsies&mdash;two rather portly women of
middle age and two slender girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are those people?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the <i>gozver&ecirc;</i> (cunning)
Lovells,&rdquo; replied Lena.&nbsp; Then I remembered that for
some time past I had carried in my notebook several cuttings
grown dingy with age, relating to traditional practices
characteristic of this family.&nbsp; Two paragraphs will suffice
as specimens.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A domestic servant told a remarkable story
yesterday before a West London magistrate.&nbsp; She said that a
gipsy called at the house and asked her to buy some laces.&nbsp;
She refused, and prisoner then offered to tell her fortune for a
shilling.&nbsp; Witness agreed, and the woman told her fortune,
and she (witness) gave her two shillings, and asked her for the
change.&nbsp; Prisoner said she would tell her young man&rsquo;s
name by the planet.&nbsp; Witness had a half-sovereign and two
half-crowns in her purse, and prisoner asked her to let her have
the coins to cross the palm of her hand with.&nbsp; She handed
her the coins, and the woman crossed her palm.&nbsp; She then
asked her to fetch a glass of water, and, on her returning with
it, told her to drink it.&nbsp; Afterwards she told her to pray,
and then, apparently putting the 10s. and the two half-crowns in
her pocket-handkerchief, placed the handkerchief in her bodice,
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>and told
her not to take it out for twenty minutes.&nbsp; After that the
woman left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magistrate: &lsquo;Did you take the handkerchief
out?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I waited for twenty minutes or so, and
then I took it out, and instead of the 10s. and the two
half-crowns I found two pennies and a farthing.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Laughter.)&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, the above is a variant of the ancient Gypsy trick
known as the <i>hokano bawro</i> (big swindle).&nbsp; Something
equally Gypsy, as we shall see, clings to our second example.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The local police have had their attention
engaged during the week in connection with an alleged
extraordinary occurrence whereby a shopgirl became, under
supposed hypnotic influence, the dupe of two gipsy women.&nbsp;
From inquiry it appears that on Saturday afternoon two gipsy
women, having the appearance of mother and daughter, entered a
baby-linen shop, and seem to have exerted such a remarkable
influence over the girl that she was induced to hand over to them
articles of wear amounting in value to between &pound;8 and
&pound;9.&nbsp; Before they left the shop she recovered her
self-possession sufficiently to express doubt as to whether they
would return with the goods or money, and her fears were allayed
somewhat by receiving from her visitors in the shape of security
a lady&rsquo;s beautiful gold ring and chain.&nbsp; Subsequently
the young lady, suspecting the genuineness <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>of the
pledges, took them to a jeweller, who declared the value of the
ring and chain to be not more than a couple of shillings.&nbsp;
The shopgirl is unable to account for her want of self-possession
in the presence of the gipsies, and states that she felt she
might have given them anything they asked for.&nbsp; There were a
good many gipsies located in the district, but on a visit to the
encampment in company with the police the girl did not recognize
her two visitors.&nbsp; The remarkable occurrence has given rise
to much comment in the locality.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is something strangely akin to the Romany mesmerism to
which allusion is made by &ldquo;The Scholar-Gipsy,&rdquo;
whose</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;. . . mates had arts to rule as they
desir&rsquo;d<br />
The workings of men&rsquo;s brains;<br />
And they can bind them to what thoughts they will.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As is well known, Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s poem is based upon
the following passage in Joseph Glanvill&rsquo;s <i>Vanity of
Dogmatizing</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That one man should be able to bind the
thoughts of another, and determine them to their particular
objects, will be reckoned in the first rank of Impossibles; Yet
by the power of advanc&rsquo;d Imagination it may very probably
be effected; and story abounds with Instances.&nbsp; I&rsquo;le
trouble the Reader but with one; and the hands from which I had
it, make me secure of the truth on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; There <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>was very
lately a lad in the University of Oxford, who, being of very
pregnant and ready parts, and yet wanting the encouragement of
preferment, was by his poverty forced to leave his studies there,
and to cast himself upon the wide world for livelyhood.&nbsp;
Now, his necessities growing daily on him, and wanting the help
of friends to relieve him; he was at last forced to joyn himself
to a company of Vagabond Gypsies, whom occasionally he met with,
and to follow their trade for a maintenance.&nbsp; Among these
extravagant people, by the insinuating subtility of his carriage,
he quickly got so much of their love and esteem; that they
discover&rsquo;d to him their Mystery; in the practice of which,
by the pregnancy of his wit and partz he soon grew so good a
proficient, as to out-do his Instructours.&nbsp; After he had
been a pretty while well exercis&rsquo;d in the Trade; there
chanc&rsquo;d to ride by a couple of Scholars who had formerly
bin of his acquaintance.&nbsp; The Scholars had quickly spyed out
their old friend, among the Gypsies; and their amazement to see
him among such society, had well-nigh discover&rsquo;d him; but
by a sign he prevented their owning him before that crew; and
taking one of them aside privately, desir&rsquo;d him with his
friend to go to an Inn, not far distant thence, promising there
to come to them.&nbsp; They accordingly went thither, and he
follows; after their first salutations, his friends enquire how
he came to live so odd a life as that was, and to joyn himself
with such a cheating beggerly company.&nbsp; The <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>Scholar-Gypsy having given them an account of the
necessity, which drove him to that kind of life; told them, that
the people he went with were not such Impostours as they were
taken for, but that they had a traditional kind of learning among
them, and could do wonders by the power of Imagination, and that
himself had learned much of their Art, and improved it further
than themselves could.&nbsp; And to evince the truth of what he
told them, he said he&rsquo;d remove into another room, leaving
them to discourse together; and upon his return tell them the sum
of what they had talked of; which accordingly he perform&rsquo;d,
giving them a full account of what had pass&rsquo;d between them
in his absence.&nbsp; The Scholars being amaz&rsquo;d at so
unexpected a discovery, earnestly desir&rsquo;d him to unriddle
the mystery.&nbsp; In which he gave them satisfaction, by telling
them, that what he did was by the power of Imagination, his
Phancy binding theirs; and that himself had dictated to them the
discourse they held together, while he was from them: That there
were warrantable wayes of heightening the Imagination to that
pitch, as to bind another&rsquo;s; and that when he had
compass&rsquo;d the whole secret, some parts of which he said he
was yet ignorant of, he intended to leave their company, and give
the world an account of what he had learned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One sometimes wonders whether the world would have cared one
jot about the revelations which the <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Oxford Scholar here promises, for to
the majority the &ldquo;Gypsies&rdquo; are almost tabu.</p>
<p>In a letter which I received from that perfect Scholar-Gypsy
and Gypsy-Scholar, the late Francis Hindes Groome, he tells how
he once stumbled upon a typical critic.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Three or four years ago I gave a lecture on
Gypsies at Greenock, and a well-dressed man came up after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There were some things,&rsquo; he remarked,
&lsquo;that I quite liked in your lecture, but on a good many
points <i>you were absolutely wrong</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course you&rsquo;ve studied the
question?&rsquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;I looked up
the article &ldquo;Gypsies&rdquo; in Dr. Brewer&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary of Fable</i> just before coming
along.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Talking of critics reminds me how I once received something of
a shock to the nerves during the opening sentences of a lecture
on &ldquo;Gypsy Customs.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not far from the platform
where I stood, there sat a well-to-do horse-dealer who, having
married a pure-bred Gypsy, was presumably in possession of
&ldquo;inside information.&rdquo;&nbsp; The vision of his face,
all alertness and curiosity, caused me a momentary
disturbance.&nbsp; What would this critic make of my
disclosures?&nbsp; How would he take my revelations?&nbsp;
Warming to my subject, however, I was made happy <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>by my
auditor interjecting such remarks as &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where does the man get it all from?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sometimes
he would punctuate his exclamations by vigorously slapping his
knee and laughing aloud.&nbsp; Certainly his ejaculations added a
piquancy to my tales gathered from Gypsy tents.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>But to return to Peterborough Fair.</p>
<p>About the middle of the afternoon, as I stood on a grassy
mound overlooking the horses, I spied near a group of animals my
old friend, Anselo Draper, flourishing a long-handled whip.&nbsp;
This swart East Anglian roamer wore a dark brown coat of
Newmarket cut, slouch hat of soft green felt, and crimson
neckerchief neatly tied at the throat.&nbsp; Along an open space
between the rows of horses sauntered his two pretty daughters,
Jemima and Ph&oelig;be, bareheaded and bare-armed, their laughing
voices ringing out merrily, while at their heels followed two
little brothers cracking whips as became budding
horse-dealers.</p>
<p>Quite a head above the Gaskins and Brinkleys with whom she was
talking loudly, stood Wythen, Anselo&rsquo;s wife, who, happening
to look my way, smiled and came towards me, holding out the empty
bowl of her pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a bit of <i>tuvalo</i> (tobacco) about you,
<i>rashai</i> (parson)?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dying for a
smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>So bok ke-divus</i>?&rdquo; (What luck to-day?) I
inquired, handing over my pouch.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;<i>Bikin</i>&rsquo;d
<i>tsh&icirc;tsh&icirc;</i>&rdquo; (Sold nothing), she replied,
jerking her whip towards the ponies, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll
<i>duker</i> (tell fortunes) a bit this evening,&rdquo; adjusting
her black hat with its large ostrich feathers and gaudy orange
bow set jauntily at the side.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On my pretending to ridicule <i>duker</i>in, she
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, now, what&rsquo;s the difference between a
Gypsy telling fortunes at a fair and a parson <i>roker</i>in
(preaching) in church of a Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a riddle,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s beyond me to answer it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when folks do bad things, you foretell a bad
future for them, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; And when they do right,
you promises &rsquo;em a good time?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the
difference then between you and me?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a low-class
fortune-teller and you&rsquo;s a high-class fortune-teller.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;s had a deal of eddication.&nbsp; My only school has
been the fairs, race-courses, and sich-like.&nbsp; But I bet I
can tell a fortune as well as you any day.&nbsp; Let me tell
yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she did.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As we stood there and talked, I noticed that the woman looked
worried about something, and presently I heard her say to Anselo,
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t found it yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a brooch
that she had lost.&nbsp; Then I told how once I lost and found a
ring.&nbsp; One Sunday morning just before service, I stood on
the gravel swinging my arms in physical exercises as a freshener
before going to church, and suddenly I heard the tinkle of my
ring on the yellow gravel.&nbsp; <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>As only a few minutes remained
before church time, I thought of a child&rsquo;s method of
finding a thing quickly, and, turning myself round three times, I
tossed upon the ground a smooth black pebble, and, going,
forward, lo, there was the ring close to the pebble.</p>
<p>Eyeing me curiously, Wythen remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what we says about people as does that sort
of thing?&nbsp; Well, we reckons they has dealings with the
<i>Beng</i> (Devil).</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little &rsquo;un, my old granny would do
things like that, and she used to say that when you sees a star
falling you must wish a wish, and if you do it afore the <i>stari
pogers</i> (the star breaks) your wish will come true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems that among Gypsies &ldquo;wishing a wish&rdquo;
sometimes means a curse.&nbsp; It was at Peterborough Fair in
1872 that Groome saw a blind Gypsy child&mdash;made blind, he was
told, through the father wishing a wish.&nbsp; Akin to this is
the belief in the evil eye.&nbsp; A Battersea Gypsy mother would
not let her baby be seen by its half-witted uncle, for fear his
looking at it should turn its black hair red.</p>
<p>After leaving Wythen, I sauntered along, making mental notes
of Gypsies all around, among whom were local Brinkleys, the
far-travelled Greens, some Loveridges, and other Midland
Gypsies.&nbsp; I was about to move away towards the pleasure
fair, when a dealer standing near some ponies caught my
eye.&nbsp; I had never seen the man before, but as he looked a
thorough Gypsy, I drew alongside and accosted <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>him in
Romany.&nbsp; For a moment he stared at my clerical frock-coat
and broad-brimmed hat, and then calmly remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, pal, you look born to them things you&rsquo;ve
got on, you do really.&nbsp; You reckons to attend fairs at these
here cathedral places, don&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I once
see you at Ely, or was it Chester?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this man I was nothing more than a Gypsy
&ldquo;dragsman&rdquo; disguised in clerical garb.&nbsp;
Accordingly, he lowered his voice as he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See this here pony?&nbsp; Will you sell it for
me?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll do it easy enough with your
experience.&nbsp; On my honour it ain&rsquo;t a <i>bongo yek</i>
(wrong &rsquo;un), nor yet a <i>tshordo grai</i>&rdquo; (stolen
horse).</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the price?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you get a tenner for it,&rdquo; he replied,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be a <i>b&acirc;</i> (sovereign) for
yourself.&nbsp; What say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Saw tatsho</i> (All right).&nbsp; <i>Jaw</i>
&rsquo;<i>vr&icirc; konaw</i>&rdquo; (Go away now).&nbsp; And in
less than ten minutes after taking my stand by the little animal,
I had a bid from a young farmer of the small-holder type.&nbsp;
His offer was accompanied by some adverse criticism.&nbsp; Who
ever heard a man praise the horse he intended to buy?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine the pony for yourself,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>He looked at its teeth.&nbsp; He lifted its feet one by
one.&nbsp; He pinched and punched it all over.&nbsp; The pony was
next trotted to and fro, and so pleased was the farmer with the
animal&rsquo;s behaviour that he promptly handed over ten pounds
and led the pony <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>away.&nbsp; On seeing that I had completed the
business, my Gypsy friend, who was just round the corner, came
up, and on my giving up the money, he put one of the sovereigns
into my hand.&nbsp; When I got away I had a good laugh to myself,
and it took me some time to get my face straight.</p>
<p>Walking back into the heart of the town, I saw a dusty,
ill-clad party of Gypsies going slowly along with a light dray
drawn by a young horse with flowing mane and long tail, and when
they reached the corner where I was standing, I spoke to the
woman who was at the horse&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; She said she was a
Smith, and when I pointed to the name Hardy on the dray, she
remarked, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nobbut a travelling
name.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be noted that Gypsies are extremely
careless about their names.</p>
<p>At a later hour in a field behind the pleasure fair, I found
the comfortable <i>v&acirc;do</i> of my friend, Anselo Draper,
and tapped at the van door with the knob of my stick.&nbsp;
Quickly the door opened, and thrusting out his dark, handsome
head, Anselo shouted, &ldquo;<i>Av adr&ecirc;</i>,
<i>baw</i>&rdquo; (Come in, friend).</p>
<p>What a contrast!&nbsp; Outside: a very babel of blaring
sounds, a dark sky reflecting the glow of a myriad naphtha
flares.&nbsp; Within: cosiness and warmth, red curtains,
glittering mirrors, polished brasses, and a good fire.&nbsp; Over
the best teacups (taken tenderly from a corner cupboard) Anselo
and his wife talked of their travels.&nbsp; They had been as far
north as Glasgow that summer, and had sold a good
<i>v&acirc;do</i> <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>(van) to one of the Boswells at Newcastle Fair.&nbsp;
They had decided to winter at Southend-on-Sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
shall make a tent, a big one, and very jolly it will be with a
<i>yog</i> (fire) in the baulk.&nbsp; To be sure, there will be
plenty of mumpers (low-class van-dwellers) around us, but we
shall not be the only <i>tatshen&ecirc; Romanitshel</i>s (real
Gypsies) stopping there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next, Anselo plunged into an account of a low dealer&rsquo;s
trick at the horse fair.&nbsp; It seemed that this dealer had
sold two horses to a farmer for forty pounds.&nbsp; A stranger
coming up to the farmer offered to buy them at a higher price, so
into a tavern they retired to talk things over.&nbsp; During
drinks the stranger continually offered more money for the
horses, and the farmer remained there a longer time than was good
for him.&nbsp; At last when the man was hopelessly muddled the
stranger disappeared.&nbsp; Nor had the horses so far been seen
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s not so much of that done as there
was.&nbsp; My father knew a Gypsy who died up in Yorkshire, a
desprit hand at <i>grai-tshor</i>in (horse-stealing), and to this
day they say, &lsquo;If you shake a bridle over his grave,
he&rsquo;ll jump up and steal a horse.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Both
Wythen and Anselo laughed merrily as I told a tale I once heard
of a Gypsy who had been &ldquo;away&rdquo; for a space.&nbsp;
Coming out of the prison gate, he was met by a fellow who asked
him what he had been in there for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For finding a horse,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>&ldquo;But surely they would never jug you for finding
a horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but you see I found this one before his owner had
lost him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anselo admitted that this sort of thing was not at all
uncommon in the old days, and two of his uncles had to take a
trip across the water for similar practices.</p>
<p>When I left my friends and hastened to catch my train, the
pleasure fair was in full blast, noisy organs, cymbals and drums,
shrieking whistles, and the dull muffled roar of innumerable
human voices, sounds which long haunted my ears, and, looking
back from the moving train, there still floated from the distance
the din and rattle of the receding fair.</p>

134</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A FORGOTTEN HIGHWAY&mdash;&ldquo;ON THE
ROAD&rdquo; WITH JONATHAN&mdash;THE PATRIN&mdash;THE GHOST OF THE
HAYSTACK</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">We</span> was all brought up on
this Old Dyke.&nbsp; We&rsquo;s <i>hatsh</i>&rsquo;d (camped) on
it in all weathers.&nbsp; I knows every yard of it.&nbsp; Ay, the
fine <i>kanengr&ecirc;</i> (hares) we&rsquo;s taken from these
here fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was my old friend, Jonathan Boswell, who with his
tilt-cart had overtaken me whilst strolling along the grass-grown
Roman Ermine Street which traverses the broad Heath stretching
southward of Lincoln.&nbsp; At the Gypsy&rsquo;s cheery
invitation, I joined him on his seat under the overarching
tilt.&nbsp; Behind us were the diminishing towers of the old
city, and right on ahead the chariot-way of the Imperial legions
ran, straight as an arrow along the Heath.&nbsp; Not a wild
expanse, mind you, like your Yorkshire moorland with its wimpling
burns and leagues of heather, though I daresay our Heath, now so
admirably tilled, was savage enough in the days when &ldquo;the
long, lone, level line of the well-kept warpath, marked at
intervals with high stones or posts as a guiding-line in fog or
snow, stretched through <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>a solitude but rarely broken, except
by the footfall of the legionaries and the plaint of the golden
plover sounding sweet from off the moorland.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Turf-covered from hedge to hedge for many a mile, the High Dyke,
as the old road is now called, may well be described as a
forgotten highway.&nbsp; Indeed, I have tramped along it mile on
mile without meeting a soul, unless mayhap it was a sun-tanned
drover slouching at the heels of half a dozen bullocks, or a
village lad asleep in a hedge-bottom, with a soft-eyed motherly
cow or two grazing not far away.</p>
<p>On this particular morning near the end of April, an unclouded
sun lit up the verdant cornlands and larch spinneys.&nbsp; It
shone upon the loins of the sturdy nag between the shafts.&nbsp;
It touched into a brighter gold the gorse-bloom on the wayside
bushes, and provoked the green-finches to fling their songs into
the air from lichened palings and bramble sprays.&nbsp; Onward we
journeyed, bumping and jolting over the uneven turfy road, and
occasionally dodging the mounds of earth thrown up by the
burrowing rabbits.&nbsp; What a picturesque figure my companion
presented in his faded bottle-green coat adorned with large pearl
buttons.&nbsp; His close-fitting dogskin cap imparted to his
swarthy, sharply-cut features a not inappropriate poacher-like
air, and I fancied the old man&rsquo;s wrinkles had deepened on
his brow since our last meeting, just after his wife&rsquo;s
death up in Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Sitting back under the hood, Jonathan here burst out with a
pretty little reminiscence.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye know, my pal, what this here bit
o&rsquo; the Old Dyke brings to my mind?&nbsp; Ay, deary me, it
takes me back to times as&rsquo;ll never, never come no
more&mdash;the days when I were a lad along with my people, and
our delations a-<i>besh</i>in (resting) on this here wery grass
we&rsquo;s passing over.&nbsp; See, there, under that warm bank
topped with thick thorns: well, I&rsquo;s slept there times on
end with my dear mammy and daddy in our tent, and my uncles and
aunts would be <i>hatsh</i>in (camping) right along this
sheltered bit.&nbsp; I can see it all while I&rsquo;s talking to
you&mdash;the carts with their shafts propped up and the smook
a-going up from the fires afore the tents, and the ponies and
donkeys grazing under the trees yonder.&nbsp; Ay, my son, them
were the times for the likes of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I minds&rdquo; (this with a
merry twinkle in his eye).&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about
it.&nbsp; It were a fine summer morning, somewheres about six
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; My mammy and daddy was up making a fire to
boil the kettle.&nbsp; I heard &rsquo;em bustling about, and I
ought to ha&rsquo; been up to help, but I were lazy-like that
morning.&nbsp; Then comes my daddy a-talking quick to hisself,
and I know&rsquo;d summut were the matter.&nbsp; He lifts up the
<i>tan-kopa</i> (tent-blanket) and hollers at me as I lay
stretched out upo&rsquo; the straw&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hatsh opr&ecirc;</i>, <i>tshavo</i>, <i>k&egrave;r
sig</i>.&nbsp; <i>De graiaw</i> and <i>mailas saw
praster</i>&rsquo;d <i>avr&icirc;</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Jaw</i>&rsquo;<i>vr&icirc;</i> an&rsquo; <i>dik</i> for
<i>len.</i>&rsquo;&nbsp; (Get up, boy, make haste.&nbsp; The
horses and donkeys have all run away.&nbsp; Go forth and look for
them.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I were out and off in a jiffey.&nbsp; I never stopped
to <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>get
dressed.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more, me not thinking what I was
a-doing, I throws away the only thing I had on my back&mdash;my
shirt&mdash;just as you toss off your coat when you&rsquo;s in a
hurry, and away I goes down the long road to find the
animals.&nbsp; Whilst I were away, all the family, my big
brothers and sisters, and them delations as I spoke of, had
gathered round the fires for <i>sawla-hawben</i> (breakfast),
an&rsquo; they hadn&rsquo;t finished when I got back with the
hosses and donkeys.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d clean forgot how I were
fixed, an&rsquo;, my gom, didn&rsquo;t they laff when they set
eyes on me; an&rsquo; my blessed mammy, she shouts&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Kai s&icirc; t&icirc;ro gad</i>, <i>m&rsquo;o
rinkeno tshavo</i>?&rsquo; (Where&rsquo;s your shirt, my pretty
boy?)&nbsp; Into the tent I dived, an&rsquo; I weren&rsquo;t long
dressing, for I wanted to be gitting my share o&rsquo; the
<i>balovas</i> an&rsquo; <i>yora</i>s (ham and eggs).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Occasionally the spinneys skirting the deserted road obscured
the view of the far-off Wolds, but one could forgive these
temporary interventions, for the sprays of larch and beech
hanging out from the little woods were delicate in their new
spring garb, and as the breezes caught them they rose and sank
with a beautiful feathery droop.&nbsp; Now across the fields on
our left hand there came into view a familiar landmark, Dunston
Pillar, concerning which I once heard a story from the lips of
Bishop Edward Trollope, a whilom neighbour of mine.</p>
<p>At one time Lincoln Heath was a vast unenclosed rabbit warren
dotted over with fir woods and quarries, and at times travellers
lost their way upon it.&nbsp; So <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Dunston Pillar was erected, and a
lantern was placed on top to guide benighted wayfarers over the
Heath.&nbsp; Doubtless the old lighthouse served its purpose
well, yet it did not always enable people to reach their own
homes in safety, for the locality was infested with robbers on
the look out for travelling gentry.&nbsp; Not far from the Pillar
stood an old coaching inn, the &ldquo;Green Man,&rdquo; and one
night, after assisting their driver to his box, two gentlemen who
had been carousing there thought it prudent to remind their man
thus: &ldquo;John, be sure you keep the Pillar light upon your
right, and then we shall reach Lincoln safely.&rdquo;&nbsp;
However, when the two awoke at daybreak and found themselves
still near the Pillar, one of them called out, &ldquo;Why, John,
where are we?&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which, John replied drowsily from
the box, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a&rsquo; roight, sir, the
Pillar&rsquo;s on our roight.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it was, for he
had been driving round it all night.</p>
<p>As we jogged along, Jonathan would occasionally jerk his whip
towards a rich pasture, and with a sly wink would say,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;s <i>puv</i>&rsquo;d <i>our graiaw</i> in that
field more than once.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let me explain.&nbsp; In order
to give their horses a good feed, the Gypsies when camping on the
High Dyke would turn their animals overnight into a nice fat
pasture, taking care, of course, to remove them early in the
morning.</p>
<p>At this point we drew rein, and took a meal under the lee of a
plantation in whose boughs thrushes fluted and willow-wrens made
fairy music.&nbsp; Not far away, couch-grass fires sent their
smoke <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>across the level surface of a loamy field, making the
air of the lane pungent with the scent of burning stalks.&nbsp;
Seated there under the spreading trees, my Gypsy companion
related a poaching incident with some gusto, for it is next to
impossible to dispossess the Gypsy of the notion that the wild
rabbits frisking about the moors and commons are as free to him
as to the owner of the lands on which they happen to be
playing.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One time when our folks was camping on the
Dyke a keeper comes up to the fire.&nbsp; It was evening, and we
was having some stew, and the keeper joined us.&nbsp; He were a
pleasant, good-company fellow, wery different from keepers
nowadays, and after the meal was over, my old mammy says to him,
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s two things that&rsquo;s wery good&mdash;a
drop of brandy to warm the cockles o&rsquo; your heart, and a bit
o&rsquo; black &rsquo;bacca to warm your snitch-end.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And the keeper agreed.&nbsp; Then my daddy brings out a black
bottle and mixes him a drink in a teacup, and us boys come
peeping into the tent to listen to the tales what daddy and the
keeper got a-telling.&nbsp; I can see &rsquo;em all a-sitting
there now, my old mam a-puffing her <i>sw&ecirc;gler</i> (pipe)
and the keeper and daddy blowing a big cloud till you
couldn&rsquo;t hardlins see across the tent for smook.&nbsp; But
mam never gave us boys nothink from the bottle, and when the
keeper began to get jolly, my dad tipped us a wink, and off goes
three of us wi&rsquo; the dogs, and we had a good time in the big
woods.&nbsp; Nobody came near us, and we didn&rsquo;t <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>carry the
game home that night lest we might meet a <i>gawjo</i>.&nbsp; We
know&rsquo;d a thing better than that.&nbsp; We hid the game in a
leafy hollow, and sent some of the big gells in the morning with
sacks, and they brought all home safe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two miles onward we stopped a few minutes at Byard&rsquo;s
Leap to look at the large iron horseshoes embedded in the
turf.&nbsp; It is these shoes that help to perpetuate the local
legend which gives the hamlet its name.&nbsp; Here is the Gypsy
version of the tradition.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Hundreds and hundreds of years ago, there
was a wicked witch what lived in a stone-pit wi&rsquo; big dark
trees hanging over it.&nbsp; This woman did a lot of mischief on
the farms all round, witching the stock in the fields, and she
cast sickness on people young and old.&nbsp; They say the witch
was once a beautiful girl who sold her blood to the <i>Beng</i>
(Devil), and that&rsquo;s how she got her powers.&nbsp; At last
she grew wery ugly, and still went on working great harm.&nbsp;
One day the folks of that neighbourhood met together and tossed
up to see who was to kill the witch.&nbsp; It was a shepherd who
had to do it, though it went against his mind, as he had often
played with the witch when she was a beautiful girl.&nbsp;
However, he promised to put an end to her, and set off to choose
a horse to ride on.&nbsp; All the horses on the farm were driven
down to a pond.&nbsp; One of them was a blind one, an old
favourite of the farmer&rsquo;s, which he wouldn&rsquo;t allow to
be killed.&nbsp; Now, while the horses were drinking, the
shepherd <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>was to <i>wuser</i> a <i>b&acirc;</i> (throw a stone)
over the horses&rsquo; backs into the water, and the one that
looked up first was the one he was to ride.&nbsp; Well, if the
poor old blind horse didn&rsquo;t lift up its head, so he saddled
it and bridled it and rode off to the stone-pit.&nbsp; When he
got there he shouted, &lsquo;Come out, my lass, I want to speak
to you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m suckling my cubs;&rsquo;&mdash;she had
two bairns, and the shepherd was said to be their
father&mdash;&lsquo;wait till I&rsquo;ve tied my shoe-strings,
and then I&rsquo;ll come.&rsquo;&nbsp; Soon she came out, and,
springing on to the horse&rsquo;s back behind the shepherd, she
dug her claws into the animal&rsquo;s flesh, while the shepherd
rode poor blind Bayard&mdash;that was the horse&rsquo;s
name&mdash;towards the cross-roads, and on the way there the
<i>grai</i> (horse) gave a tremendous jump&mdash;sixty
feet&mdash;and both the riders were thrown off; the witch was
killed on the spot, the shepherd was lamed for life, and the
blind horse fell down dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Starting from the first set of four horseshoes in the turf, I
measured the distance in strides to the next set of four, and,
roughly speaking, found it to be sixty feet.</p>
<p>Here our roads diverged, Jonathan going westward towards the
&ldquo;Cliff,&rdquo; while I took the turn for Sleaford.</p>
<p>Within three weeks from this meeting with Jonathan on the High
Dyke, I had business calling me to the town of Newark-on-Trent,
where, as luck had it, the May horse-fair was in full swing, and
under <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>the shadow of the Castle by the waterside I met my
Gypsy friend once more.&nbsp; In a corner of the fairground,
which was crowded with horses, I found Jonathan in company with
one of the Smiths, and the two men were drinking ale out of big
horn tumblers rimmed with silver.&nbsp; Petulengro had a nice
<i>v&acirc;do</i>, and, going up to it, I read the name
&ldquo;Bailey, Warrington.&rdquo;&nbsp; He explained that he was
breaking new ground, and therefore had taken a change of
name.&nbsp; Like most Gypsies, he had some pets&mdash;two dogs, a
bantam cock and hen, a jackdaw, and a canary.&nbsp; As Jonathan
had absorbing business on hand, I did not see him again until
evening, when I joined him in his tilt-cart, and we set off
towards Ollerton.&nbsp; Underneath the vehicle were slung several
tent rods, notched, or numbered, in order to facilitate the
erection of the tent.&nbsp; Said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m expecting
my nephew to join us to-morrow&mdash;that&rsquo;s
Charley&mdash;he&rsquo;s promised to come after us, so I must lay
the <i>patrin</i>s (signs) for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us see how this is done.</p>
<p>At a crossing of two highways, a few miles out of the town,
Jonathan went to the hedge-bottom and plucked a bunch of long
grass, then upon a clearing among the tussocks on the wayside he
divided the bunch into three portions, carefully placing these
with their tips pointing in the direction which we were about to
take.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to do this at every cross-road, for there&rsquo;s no telling
exactly <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>where we shall stop to-night.&nbsp; But Charley is
bound to find us, for he&rsquo;ll <i>dik avr&icirc;</i> for
<i>mandi</i>&rsquo;s <i>patrin</i>&rdquo; (look out for my
sign).</p>
<p>There are many varieties in the form of the <i>patrin</i>, for
no two families use exactly the same sign.&nbsp; I have heard
Gypsies who were about to separate into parties, discussing the
particular form of <i>patrin</i> to be used by the advance guard,
so that those who were following would know exactly what to look
for, and whereabouts on the roadside they might expect to find
it.</p>
<p>A Suffolk friend, whilst sitting unobserved on a fence in the
twilight, watched some Gypsies laying a <i>patrin</i> formed of
small elm twigs, their tips indicating the direction taken.&nbsp;
A peculiar form of <i>patrin</i> I once saw was a wisp of grass
tied round a sapling in the hedgerow.</p>
<p>For myself, I never see a <i>patrin</i> on the roadside
without recalling Ursula&rsquo;s pathetic story in <i>The Romany
Rye</i>.&nbsp; Readers who know their Borrow will remember how
the woman followed her husband for a great many miles by means of
his signs left on the wayside.</p>
<p>Between Kneesall and Wellow a halt was made, and, having lit a
fire of sticks under the shadow of a wood, we warmed some stew in
a black pot.&nbsp; As we sprawled on the grass, a fox dashed
across the road with a rabbit dangling from its jaws, and
Jonathan shouted in the hope of making Reynard drop the bunny,
but in vain.&nbsp; Then I told him how once I <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>saw a fox
capture and kill a rabbit on the slope of a warren.&nbsp; He was
about to trot off with his prey when I gave a lusty shout which
made him halt and look round at me for a moment.&nbsp; Seeing
that I was quite a hundred yards away, Reynard dropped the
rabbit, scratched a hole, and buried his capture, carefully
spreading the loose earth and stones over the place with his
sharp nose.&nbsp; Then he made for the woods.&nbsp; Now, though I
searched diligently for that buried rabbit, I could not for the
life of me discover it, the entire surface of the warren-slope
being so dotted over with recent rabbit-scratchings strewn with
small stones.</p>
<p>While Jonathan was making some small repair of the harness, I
drew from my pocket a few newspaper cuttings and letters, in one
of which was a dialogue between two Gypsies, a tiny boy and an
aged man, who had met upon the road&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A bit o&rsquo; the old style, I call that,&rdquo; was
my companion&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>After we had yoked in and were about to start off, my old
Gypsy pulled out his handkerchief to catch a sneeze on the
wing.&nbsp; He was successful, and, unnoticed by him, a little
wooden animal fell to the grass.&nbsp; On picking it up, I handed
back to him a dog with a tail broken off and one foot missing,
and he grabbed at it excitedly, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t <i>nasher</i> (lose) that for a
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little fetish I remembered to have seen on a <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>former
occasion.&nbsp; Jonathan had put it on the top of a gatepost and
was talking to it, as he puffed a cloud of tobacco smoke.&nbsp;
For some reason, he was never willing to discuss the subject.</p>

<p>Pursuing our journey, we came to the little town of Ollerton,
and after a halt at one of the inns we travelled onward through
Edwinstowe until we reached a tract of ferny, heathery country,
where we drew up, unyoked and unharnessed the horse, and in
wonderfully quick time had our little tent erected.&nbsp; You
have sometimes heard people say, &ldquo;Poor Gypsies,&rdquo; yet
if you had travelled with them, as I have, you would hear it
said, &ldquo;Poor <i>gawj&ecirc;</i> (gentiles), we feels sorry
for &rsquo;em, cooped up in their stuffy houses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There is nothing so healthy as a tent under the open sky, with
the wind blowing freely around you and the birds singing their
canticles in the woods hard by.&nbsp; I speak from experience in
regard to tent life, for under Jonathan&rsquo;s tuition I learned
long ago how to construct a Gypsy&rsquo;s tent of ash or hazel
rods thrust into the ground and their tapering ends bent and
fixed into a ridge-pole, the whole being covered with coarse
brown blankets pinned on with stout 3-inch pins.&nbsp; (The
Gypsies use the long thorns of the wild sloe, or thin elder
skewers.)&nbsp; In such a tent I have slept nightly for many
months in succession.&nbsp; It is grand to sit at your tent door,
building castles in the air, which at any rate cost very little
in upkeep.</p>
<p>Bosky Sherwood with its oaks and birches and uncurling bracken
stretched away towards the west, <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>and, strolling along the unfenced
road, lo, an old woman with her apron full of sticks was seen
coming down a glade.&nbsp; She turned out to be Rachel Shaw, whom
we accompanied to where, round a corner, the camp of the Gypsy
Shaws lay within a secluded alcove.&nbsp; This was a pleasant
surprise.&nbsp; Here, by the fire, sat Tiger Shaw and his three
grown-up daughters, fine strapping girls.&nbsp; I had often heard
of &ldquo;Fiddling&rdquo; Tiger, whose children were said to be
excellent dancers.&nbsp; It was said of their father that he
could play tunes by thumping with his fists upon his bare
chest.&nbsp; We sat chatting with them till the moon rose, a full
golden disk, over the woods.&nbsp; The night air was sweet with
forest smells exhaling from bursting oak-buds and sheets of wood
hyacinths.&nbsp; A rare place for owls is Sherwood, and more than
once as we sat there, a broad-winged bird came out of the black
shadows and flew away hooting down the road.</p>
<p>Old Tiger, who hails from the Low Country between Lynn and St.
Ives, remembers when the &ldquo;Jack o&rsquo; Lantern&rdquo; used
to flicker by night in those parts in the days of his childhood,
and of ghost tales he has a rich store.&nbsp; One of his best
tales is the ghost of the haystack, which I give in my own
words.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One night a Gypsy and his wife went to take
some hay from a stack at the back of a mansion.&nbsp; As they
were getting it, they looked up and saw on the top of the stack a
wizened old man wearing a three-cornered hat, a cut-away coat
with silver buttons, <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>knee-breeches, silk stockings,
buckled shoes, and by his side hung a curious sword.&nbsp; At
this sight they stood amazed, then, gathering courage, the Gypsy
woman looked up and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If this is your hay, sir, may we take a handful
for our pony?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The figure on the stack never spoke, but nodded his
head, so they took a lot, and, departing, left a trail of hay
reaching from the stack to the camp.&nbsp; Next morning the
squire of the mansion came along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You rascally vagabonds, you thieving rogues, how
dare you steal my hay?&nbsp; If you had asked me, I&rsquo;d have
given you some.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But we <i>did</i> get leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How so?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they described the gentleman on the stack, giving
the details as already told.&nbsp; At this the squire turned
deathly pale, and laid hold of a fence to steady himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve seen my old grandfather who
has been dead years and years, and if he gave you leave, you can
get as much of that hay as you please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you may be sure they did.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first grey light of dawn was creeping down the road and
waking the life of the woods, when we were called from our
slumbers by a cheery &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; and Jonathan sprang up
to receive his nephew, who had already drawn his
<i>v&acirc;do</i> upon the grass; indeed, before we had dressed,
Charley had gathered sticks <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>for the breakfast fire, and by the
time that our meal was finished, the sun was gilding the
tree-tops.&nbsp; Now we were ready for the departure, and, moving
along the road, we found the Shaws also taking the <i>drom</i>
(road).&nbsp; By the side of the <i>v&acirc;do</i> walked
Tiger&rsquo;s girls, their loosened hair blowing in the wind, and
going along they gathered the yellow cowslips.</p>
<p>Onward through the gorsy lanes we travelled together as far as
Mansfield, where our merry party became divided, the Boswells
taking the highway leading through North Derbyshire to Sheffield,
the Shaws going westward towards Matlock, and myself setting off
in a southerly direction.</p>
<p>Just where Robin Hood&rsquo;s Hills begin to rise beyond the
red-stemmed pines of the Thieves&rsquo; Wood, I came upon a
resplendent caravan of the Pulman type drawn up on the wayside
turf a long way from any village.&nbsp; Near by sat two persons,
a man past middle age, wearing a kilt and tam-o&rsquo;-shanter,
who had for companion a pretty lass in her teens, with long brown
hair.&nbsp; On the ground between them stood a big crystal jar,
and with long forks the two were spearing cubes of preserved
ginger.&nbsp; Their backs being turned towards me, they gave a
little start of surprise as I went up, and, raising my hat,
inquired, &ldquo;Dr. Gordon Stables?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name,&rdquo; said he, and, inviting me
to join them on the grass, he dispatched the girl for another
fork, with which very soon I, too, was spearing for ginger.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>Here
before me was the &ldquo;Gentleman Gypsy,&rdquo; whose writings
had been familiar to me since boyhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think it strange,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;when I tell you that I have no memory for faces, but I
rarely fail to remember the look of any tree I have once seen by
the roadside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Gypsies were mentioned, the good doctor had grateful
reminiscences of them.&nbsp; During many years of road-travel he
had often come upon the wandering folk, and he liked them.&nbsp;
They were cheerful people who never forgot a kindness.&nbsp; They
were most obliging withal, and readily lent their horses to pull
his somewhat heavy &ldquo;house on wheels&rdquo; up the stiff
inclines.&nbsp; Altogether, he had a very good word for the
Gypsies.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon I was standing in the churchyard at Selston,
where lay the fragments of the headstone of a Romany chief, Dan
Boswell.&nbsp; An irreverent bull was declared to have been
responsible for the shattered condition of the stone upon which a
quaint epitaph was now faintly visible.&nbsp; It ran as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lodged in many a town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve travelled many a year,<br />
But death at length hath brought me down<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To my last lodging here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My late father-in-law, formerly a curate of Selston,
remembered how Gypsies paid visits to this grave and <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>poured
libations of ale upon it.&nbsp; The adjacent common, long since
enclosed, was once much frequented by the nomad tribes.</p>
<p>My resting-place that evening was the pleasant Midland town of
Nottingham, and right soundly I slept after my long day on the
road.</p>
<h2><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE GYPSY OF THE TOWN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the sunny forenoon I was walking
in one of the airy suburbs of Nottingham, and, passing by the
entrance to some livery stables, I noticed on a sign-board in
prominent yellow letters on a black ground the surname of
Boss.&nbsp; This it was that brought me to a standstill in front
of the large doors in a high wall.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Romany
name,&rdquo; I said to myself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought to find a
Gypsy here;&rdquo; and, pushing open one of the doors, I saw
before me an office with masses of brown wallflower abloom
beneath a wide-open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said a mellow voice, in response to my
knock at the little door in the porch, and, entering, I was
confronted by a handsome man of fifty, evidently the master of
the establishment, neatly dressed, well groomed, and unmistakably
Romany.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Boss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Romanitshel tu shan</i>?&rdquo; (You are a
Gypsy?)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;vali</i>, <i>baw</i>.&nbsp; <i>Av ta besh
t&#259;l&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (Yes, mate.&nbsp; Come and sit
down.)&nbsp; The words were accompanied <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>by a low,
musical laugh that was pleasant to hear.&nbsp; He then conducted
me to a garden seat where we sat and talked in the May
sunshine.&nbsp; Generally my companion would use the inflected
dialect of the old-time Gypsies, but at intervals he dropped into
the <i>pogado tshib</i>, the &ldquo;broken language,&rdquo; as
spoken by the average English Gypsy of to-day.&nbsp; For which
lapses he apologized: &ldquo;I wonder what my old dad would say
to hear me <i>roker</i>in like a <i>posh-rat</i>?&rdquo; (talking
like a half-breed).&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the old roots was my
daddy, who could talk for hours in nothing but
&lsquo;double-words&rsquo;&rdquo; (<i>i.e.</i> inflected
Romany).&nbsp; &ldquo;There were the &lsquo;double-words&rsquo;
and the other way&mdash;the broken language.&nbsp; Some of us
young upstarts never picked up all the &lsquo;double-words&rsquo;
our parents used, and now the poor old language is fast going to
pieces.&nbsp; What with these Gypsy novels and their bits of
Romany talk&mdash;my girl reads them to me&mdash;why, everybody
is getting to know it.&nbsp; I once heard a gentleman say that
our language was a made-up gibberish.&nbsp; But he was
wrong.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a real language, and an old one at
that.&nbsp; But, as I was saying, it&rsquo;s getting blown very
much nowadays.&nbsp; Why, down in Kent, Surrey, and Sussex there
are whole villages where you can hear Romany talked on all sides
of you.&nbsp; The little shopkeepers know it.&nbsp; The publicans
can <i>roker</i> (talk Gypsy) a bit.&nbsp; The stable-boys throw
it at one another.&nbsp; And you can&rsquo;t stir in the lanes
without meeting a kiddie <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>with the eyes and hair of a
Gypsy&mdash;blest if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noticing my flow of the <i>kawlo tshib</i> (black language,
<i>i.e.</i> Romany), Boss tapped me familiarly on the knee:
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t reckon you up at all, <i>rashai</i>
(parson).&nbsp; How have you picked it all up?&nbsp; Have you
been sweet on a Gypsy girl, or have you <i>romer</i>&rsquo;d
<i>yek</i>?&rdquo; (married one).</p>
<p>Then with all a Gypsy&rsquo;s restlessness, he sprang up and
led me to his villa residence over the way, where, apologizing
for the absence of his wife, he introduced me to his daughter, a
tall girl of twenty or more, gentle, refined-looking, with
fathomless Gypsy eyes and an olive tint in her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take the <i>rashai</i> for a
drive,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back for
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the tastefully ordered drawing-room I chatted with Miss
Boss, whose Romany rippled melodiously.&nbsp; A piece of
classical music stood open on the piano, and several recent
novels lay scattered about.&nbsp; On her father&rsquo;s return
within a few moments, I caught the sound of a horse pawing
impatiently outside, and presently I was seated with Jack Boss in
a smart yellow gig behind a slim &ldquo;blood&rdquo;
animal.&nbsp; As we drove through the town my companion pointed
to a carriage-horse in passing: &ldquo;<i>Wafodu grai s&icirc;
dova</i>&rdquo; (a trashy horse is that), and when I translated
his words he chuckled merrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;To think that you
know <i>that</i>, and you don&rsquo;t look a bit like a
Gypsy.&nbsp; Not a drop of the blood in you, <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>I should
think.&nbsp; You puzzle me, you really do.&nbsp; Perhaps
you&rsquo;ve got it from books.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard of such
works, but have never seen them.&nbsp; I suppose you priests can
find it all in Latin somewhere?&nbsp; Now, to look at me
you&rsquo;d never think&mdash;would you?&mdash;that I&rsquo;d
been born in a little tent&rdquo; (he bent his fingers in
semblance of curved rods) &ldquo;and had travelled on the
roads.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s years ago, yet I like to think of
those days.&nbsp; If they were rough times, we had plenty of
fun.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t I remember going with my old dad to visit
the Grays and Herons, Lovells and Stanleys, in their
tents&mdash;real Gypsies if you like.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t often
<i>dik</i> a <i>tatsheno Romanitshel konaw</i>&rdquo; (see a true
Gypsy nowadays).&nbsp; &ldquo;It gave me a deal of pleasure the
other day to meet Ike Heron in his low-crowned topper and
Newmarket coat.&nbsp; One of the old standards is Ike.&nbsp;
Perhaps you know him?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>By this time we were speeding between green hedgerows in the
open country, and when at last we pulled up at a wayside
hostelry, nothing would do but I must drink my Gypsy&rsquo;s
health.&nbsp; Then the horse&rsquo;s head was turned for
home.&nbsp; Romany topics being still to the fore, and having
recently heard of the passing of George Smith of Coalville, I
asked my companion if he had ever met the parent of the first
&ldquo;Moveable Dwellings&rsquo; Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I ever crossed his path, and I
don&rsquo;t know that I particularly wanted to.&nbsp; His <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>letters in
the papers used to <i>rile my people terribly</i>.&nbsp; We
weren&rsquo;t quite so bad as he painted us.&nbsp; It was plain
enough that he knew nothing of the real Romanies, nothing
whatever.&nbsp; Why, his &ldquo;gipsies&rdquo; were nothing but
the very poorest hedge-crawlers, with never a drop of our blood
in their bodies.&nbsp; The man meant all right, very likely, but
as for his methods&mdash;well, the less said about them the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we parted after tea at his garden gate, I wished my Gypsy
<i>kushto bok</i> (good luck).</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thing <i>that</i>, Mr. Hall, and may we both
have more of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I retain very pleasant memories of that afternoon spent in the
genial company of Mr. Jack Boss, whom I have since met several
times at horse-fairs in different parts of the country.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It has fallen to my lot to know a number of Gypsies who have
made their homes in our cities, and who, though moving in
respectable circles, still retain the old secret tongue of the
roads, as well as a marked spirit of detachment from most of the
ideas of the people among whom they live.&nbsp; Pride of race
remains.&nbsp; No matter how high he may climb, the pure Gypsy is
proud of his birth and secretly despises all who are not of his
blood.&nbsp; When talking of breezy commons, green woodsides,
rabbits, pheasants, and the like, I have seen the eyes of a
house-dwelling Gypsy grow wistful as he sighed at the visions and
memories arising within him.</p>
<p><a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>The
sedentary Gypsies are now largely in the preponderance.&nbsp; Not
that the tendency to settle is entirely a thing of our
times.&nbsp; Fifty years ago, the Gypsy colony hard by my
childhood&rsquo;s home told of a movement not then by any means
new.&nbsp; Twenty years earlier, did not Ambrose (Jasper) Smith
say to Lavengro?&mdash;&ldquo;There is no living for the poor
people, the <i>chokengris</i> (police) pursue us from place to
place, and the gorgios are becoming either so poor or miserly
that they grudge our cattle a bite of grass by the wayside, and
ourselves a yard of ground to light a fire upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many years prior to this complaint, the wholesale enclosing of
the commons, the harassing attentions of the press-gang, the
flooding of our roads by Irish vagrants, the barbaric
administration of &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; and the pressure of the
times generally, had caused many a Gypsy to adopt a sedentary
life.&nbsp; Numbers of old-fashioned Romany families, finding
life no longer tolerable in England, were allured to the colonies
by glowing accounts received from migrated friends of the freedom
and manifold opportunities for making a living across the
sea.&nbsp; All along since those times it may be said that no
year has passed without witnessing the settlement of many
Gypsies.</p>
<p>Some of my happiest &ldquo;finds&rdquo; in the way of
house-dwelling Gypsies were several aged members of the great
Boswell clan, living in the town of Derby, and to them I owe many
reminiscences of Gypsy life <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>in bygone days.&nbsp; It was from
Lincolnshire <i>Romanitshel</i>s of the same clan-name that I had
first learned of the Derby colony whose Gypsy denizens were so
entertaining that if ever I found myself within a few miles of
their Midland town I could in no way resist going to see
them.&nbsp; It must have been many years since first they settled
there, and yet they would talk of Lincolnshire as though they had
quitted its highways and byways but yesterday.&nbsp; Moreover,
these Boswells were related to some of Borrow&rsquo;s originals,
a fact which in my eyes lent no small glamour to these folk.</p>
<p>One cool spring evening I stood in a cramped yard in Derby,
and, tapping at a cottage door, I heard a tremulous voice
inviting me to enter.&nbsp; Within that little room my aged
friend, Coralina Boswell, was warming her thin hands at a few
glowing coals in the grate.&nbsp; A flickering candle on the
chimney-piece cast a fitful yellow gleam on the old lady seated
on the hearthrug not far from a truckle bed.&nbsp; Wrapped about
her shawl-wise was a portion of a scarlet blanket throwing up her
features, swarthy and deeply seamed, into strong relief.&nbsp;
She begged me to take the only chair, which I drew up to the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to see you, my son.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a lonely
old woman.&nbsp; My <i>tsh&#259;v&ecirc;</i> (children) are all
far away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here she picked up a black pipe which she
had laid down on my entering, and went on chatting about her
family, mentioning a daughter named Froniga.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;That sounds like Veronica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we name&rsquo;t her after the one that wiped the
dear Lord&rsquo;s face wiv a <i>diklo</i>&rdquo;
(handkerchief).</p>
<p>This set her thoughts a-wandering, and she went on to tell how
last night she saw strange things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in a <i>wesh</i> (wood), thick and green, and I
went on and on, and I felt wild beasts rubbing agen me, but they
never hurted me, &rsquo;cos my blessed Saviour was a-sitting wiv
His angels among the clouds just above the roundy tops o&rsquo;
the big trees.&nbsp; It was beautiful to see Him there.&nbsp; And
sometimes, as I sits here, I sees Him come into this room, as
real as when you came in yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you come so far to see the likes o&rsquo;
me?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s wery kind o&rsquo; you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s
travelled all through your country, and a nice part it is.&nbsp;
I remembers the green fields all lying in the sun by the
riverside.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Clearly she was thinking of the
Trentside haunts of her clan.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my son, will you <i>tshiv</i> some <i>kosht</i> on
the <i>yog</i> (put some wood on the fire) and light that
<i>v&acirc;va mumeli</i> (other candle) on the
chimbly-shelf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the walls of the room were several black-framed funeral
cards, in the midst of which was a blurred enlargement of a
Romany <i>v&acirc;do</i> (cart), and, seeing my eyes wandering
towards this picture, Coralina broke out again&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s my <i>rom</i>&rsquo;s (husband) wagon
there, as <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>we&rsquo;s travelled in many a year, and there he is on
the steps a-looking at me so loving-like.&nbsp; I <i>roker</i>s
(talk) to him sometimes, forgetting he&rsquo;s been gone this
many a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s a lonely life, and what would become of me
I don&rsquo;t know, if I hadn&rsquo;t some kind delations living
in this <i>gav</i>&rdquo; (town).</p>
<p>As I stepped out into the narrow yard, a bright moon silvered
the battered door and the little crisscross window of Old
Coralina&rsquo;s abode, and, walking along a crooked street, I
thought of the strange life of the woman I had just left, an
existence in which dreams and visions passed for realities.</p>

</a></p>
<p>In the same town lived another aged Gypsy, Eldi Boswell, whose
days were chiefly spent on a couch-bed smoking and
dreaming.&nbsp; Too decrepit to leave her cottage, she loved to
bask in the glow of the fire, and I recall no more picturesque
Gypsy figure than Old Eldi, with her furrowed face and her long,
dark ringlets straggling out from beneath a once gorgeous
<i>diklo</i>.&nbsp; It was easy to see that she had been a beauty
in her time, and in confidential moments she would say that in
her young days she had often been taken for her cousin,
Sanspirela Heron (the lovely wife of Ambrose Smith), whose
forename was (in <i>Lavengro</i>) changed by Borrow to
Pakomovna.&nbsp; Certainly one could not help being struck by Old
Eldi&rsquo;s large eyes.&nbsp; Much has been written about the
peculiarity of the Gypsy eye, Borrow and Leland in particular
having enlarged upon this topic.&nbsp; Not of a soft, steady <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>hue like
that of a pool in the moorland peat, it is a changeful eye of
glittering black endowed with a strange penetrative quality.</p>
<p>Born about the year 1820 at Susworth, a hamlet on the
Lincolnshire bank of the Trent, Eldi remembered not only the
names, but a host of tales in which bygone Gypsies played a
part.</p>
<p>My father, a schoolmate of Thomas Miller at Gainsborough on
the Trent, used to speak of the riverside Gypsies whom Miller
presents in his writings: <i>e.g.</i> in <i>Gideon Giles the
Roper</i> he gives pictures of the Boswells, who were probably
some of Old Eldi&rsquo;s folk.</p>
<p>For instance, if I had been reading in Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Gypsy
Word-Book</i> about that famous old rascal, Ryley Boswell, I
would say to Eldi&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know Old Ryley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartinly, I minds him well enough.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Gentleman&rsquo; Ryley, they used to call him.&nbsp; He
was a tinker, like the rest of our <i>mushaw</i> (men), but he
wouldn&rsquo;t carry his creel (grinding-outfit) on his back like
other people.&nbsp; He must have it on a little cart, and a pony
to draw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true that he had more than one wife living with
him at the same time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, he had three wives.&nbsp; There was Yoki
Shuri.&nbsp; You&rsquo;s heard tell of her, sure-ly&mdash;a wery
clever woman she was at getting money.&nbsp; Then there was Lucy
Boswell, Old Tyso&rsquo;s gell, a nicer woman never breathed, but
Ryley was rough with <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>her and made her sleep in a little
tent with his dogs Musho and Ponto.&nbsp; Nobody blamed her when
she left him and went to &rsquo;Merikay with her six
children.&nbsp; Then there was Charlotte Hammond as went away and
took on with Zacky Lee.&nbsp; A lot of those Lees round London
sprang from them.&nbsp; In his best days Ryley had heaps of money
and travelled all over the country.&nbsp; He had a fine black
mare, Bess Beldam, and he rode on her a-hunting with the gentry
up in Yorkshire.&nbsp; He was partic&rsquo;lar fond o&rsquo; that
country, was Ryley.&nbsp; I minds how fine he looked on his
splendid mare as had silver shoes, and him in a coat with golden
guineas for buttons.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s heard of him riding
slap-dash through a camp, springing over the tents and scutching
the <i>nong&ecirc; tshav&ecirc;</i> (naked children) with his
<i>tshupni</i> (whip): &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let &rsquo;em know who I
am&mdash;Ryley Boswell, King of the Gypsies.&rsquo;&nbsp; But at
last his luck left him, and he took hisself off to London with
his Yoki Shuri.&nbsp; Even to her as stuck to him through all, he
was unkind.&nbsp; One day he tied her to a cart-wheel and
leathered her, &rsquo;cos she told him of his ill-doings.&nbsp;
At London, they lived in the Potteries, but he never did no good
in the big city.&nbsp; One day, as he was skinning a rabbit, he
scratched his hand and got blood-poisoning, and died in a little
house underneath the railway arches.&nbsp; They buried him in
Brompton Churchyard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus she would spin on at great length about Ryley
Boswell.</p>
<p>Another time she would talk about the Herons.&nbsp; <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>She was old
enough to remember Niabai and Crowy (the parents of my aged
friend, Ike Heron), as well as &ldquo;handsome&rdquo; William,
&ldquo;lame&rdquo; Robert, Miller, Lusha, and other members of
the same family.&nbsp; According to her account, these fellows
were a tall, dark, big-boned, rough set.</p>
<p>Asked if she had ever known any Gypsy called Reynolds, Eldi
replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure, there was Reynolds Heron as married my Aunt
Peggy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I understood how Ambrose Smith (<i>alias</i> Reynolds)
came in his last years to adopt for his own travelling surname
the Christian name of his wife Sanspirela&rsquo;s father,
Reynolds Heron, concerning whom it is recorded that he used to
fast on the five Fridays next after the season of Lent, in memory
of the five wounds of the Saviour.</p>
<p>I used to like to hear Eldi talk of the days when artists,
squires, and their ladies would pay visits to the camp.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was my husband&rsquo;s Aunt
&lsquo;Norna&rsquo;&mdash;her proper name was Lucretia
Boswell&mdash;she was a beautiful woman, and Mr. Oakley painted a
picture of her wearing an orange shawl about her shoulders.&nbsp;
She never married, and always travelled with her sister
Deloraifi, who never married neither.&nbsp; Ay, when I was a
barefooted gell with the wind a-blowing my hair about, the
painting-gentlemen would get me to sit for my picture; and
squires would stop us in the lanes and try to pick up our
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Rascalities of which modern Gypsydom knows nothing
would creep into Eldi&rsquo;s memory-pictures.&nbsp; I mean the
wayside robberies, the bloody fights, the sheep and horse
stealing of the rough old days of her girlhood.&nbsp; She would
get so rapt away in the past that she would speak of people dead
and gone as though they were living still, and, awaking to the
present, would remark with a deep-drawn sigh&mdash;&ldquo;But,
there, I&rsquo;s seen none of &rsquo;em for a wery long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the heading of &ldquo;A Modern Enchantress,&rdquo; the
following note, describing my Gypsy friend, was communicated by
an Irish clergyman to <i>The Journal of the Gypsy Lore
Society</i> of the year 1890:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A short time since, a clergyman stopping at
my house told me that some time ago, when he was assisting in the
work of All Saints&rsquo; Parish, Derby, he had residing in the
parish a Gypsy family named Boswell.&nbsp; One of the family was
sick, and he found the greatest difficulty in getting into the
house; and when he did get in, the sick man told him that the
sooner he cleared out of the house the better&mdash;if he came to
talk about religion.&nbsp; In fact, it was only by most judicious
management, and by promises not to speak about religion till the
sick man spoke of it first, that he was able to establish a
footing in the house.&nbsp; But after a little time he got on
quite friendly terms with the family.&nbsp; He then discovered
that when any of the family were sick an old aunt came into the
room and seemed to perform <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>a kind of incantation over
them.&nbsp; His description of her performance was very like what
we read about Eastern Dervishes.&nbsp; She gradually worked
herself up into a species of frenzy, flinging her arms about and
muttering a kind of incantation or prayer, until her voice
ascended into a wild scream and descended again into a whisper as
the frenzy passed away, and she was left lying exhausted and
apparently in fainting condition on the floor.&nbsp; When she
arrived at this state she was immediately carried out of the
sick-room by her relatives.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A grey morning with a lowering sky and splashes of rain had
given place in the early forenoon to a brilliant day, and
sunbeams lit up the Humber&rsquo;s wharves and shipping as I
stepped from the steam ferry upon the Corporation Pier at
Hull.&nbsp; Often before had I visited this busy seaport on Gypsy
errands, and the cause of my present visit was to seek out the
whereabouts of the descendants of Ryley Boswell, renowned in
Gypsy history.&nbsp; From Borrow&rsquo;s <i>Romany Word-Book</i>
I had gathered that Ryley hailed from Yorkshire, and Eldi Boswell
of Derby, and the London relatives of Yoki Shuri had informed me
that Hull was a likely place to locate some of Ryley&rsquo;s
offspring.&nbsp; A few inquiries brought me the information that
a Gypsy and his wife kept a little grocery store in a back
street, which I had no difficulty in finding, though,
reconnoitring outside the shop, I saw in its exterior nothing
suggestive of the <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Romany.&nbsp; Going inside, I rapped with my foot on
the floor, and a middle-aged woman, only distantly resembling a
Gypsy, responded to my summons.&nbsp; Pointing to a barrel of
ruddy Canadians, I made request in Romany for two apples, and
immediately a change came over her face.&nbsp; The sound of the
Gypsy language produced a beaming smile where solemnity had
sat.&nbsp; After making a further purchase, I was invited into
the living-room, where I had no sooner sat down than the
woman&rsquo;s husband, looking still less like a Gypsy, entered,
but on my giving him a <i>s&acirc; shan</i> (how do?) he laughed
outright, and we had some fun.&nbsp; It tickled me not a little
to hear the pair discussing my physiognomy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he&rsquo;s got Newty&rsquo;s <i>nok</i> (nose),
that he has now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the wife asked me if I had
brought news of a fortune left to them by their Uncle Newty in
Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newty&mdash;well, I <i>have</i> heard of him.&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t he <i>bitshado pawdel</i> (transported) to Hobart
Town for horse-stealing?&nbsp; But for whom do you take
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of Newty&rsquo;s sons, for sure.&nbsp; And
here&rsquo;s your father&rsquo;s photograph&rdquo; (handing me a
daguerreotype in velvet-lined case).&nbsp; &ldquo;Now look at
yourself in the glass.&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re the wery spit of
Uncle Newton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I found myself taken for a grandson of Old Ryley and Yoki
Shuri, and my shopkeeping friends were themselves actual
grandchildren of those Gypsies of renown.&nbsp; Here was a lucky
find, and since I was <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>out upon a genealogical errand, I
availed myself of the present opportunity to scoop in a goodly
store of facts for my increasing collection of Romany
pedigrees.</p>
<p>A few years after this visit to Hull, a correspondent in
Australia imparted to me a number of facts relating to
transported Gypsies.&nbsp; Here are a few of his personal
recollections of Newton Boswell (or Boss), whom he had known as a
travelling knife-grinder at Launceston in Tasmania.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Newton, familiarly known as
&lsquo;Newty,&rsquo; seemed a nice quiet fellow, tall and spare,
with the remains of good looks.&nbsp; Polite and well-spoken, he
was not particularly Gypsy-looking, except for his walk and
build&mdash;not particularly dark.&nbsp; At the same time he
<i>did</i> look like a Gypsy.&nbsp; His eyes were of a mild
brown.&nbsp; He wore a big felt hat and a coloured
handkerchief.&nbsp; He told me that he had been popular with
ladies, that one lady who had a large house (in New South Wales,
I think), and with whom he worked as a servant or driver, took a
particular fancy to him, but he left that situation because he
wanted to be on the move.&nbsp; He said he did not like remaining
long in one place.&nbsp; Newton confirmed Borrow&rsquo;s
description of Ryley, in regard to his wearing gold coins as
buttons on his clothes, and other details.&nbsp; When I read him
parts of Borrow&rsquo;s books, he was astonished to find in print
many facts familiar to himself.&nbsp; He once brought round his
fiddle for me <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>to hear him play, which he did in the energetic,
spirited style peculiar to the race.&nbsp; He told me that he had
travelled all over Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once, many years ago, there came up to Newton&rsquo;s
grinding-barrow in Sydney a handsome, dark, beautifully dressed,
young lady who, looking him fixedly in the eyes, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Romany look about
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg your pardon, madam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a Romany look about
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, madam, do I look any different from anybody
else?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, you are wearing a yellow handkerchief
round your neck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Can&rsquo;t anybody wear a coloured
handkerchief, madam?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, they can, but they don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, madam, I <i>am</i> a Gypsy&mdash;a
pure-bred one too&mdash;my name is Boswell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And so am I a Gypsy&mdash;my name is
Lovell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She gave Newton a sovereign and invited him to call at
her house.&nbsp; He subsequently learned that she had married
some well-to-do man (a non-Gypsy) in England, who had brought her
out to Australia, and that on his returning suddenly from a trip
to the Old Country, he shot her in a passion of jealousy, and
then shot himself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some weeks later I was again exploring Hull for <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>Gypsies.&nbsp; To me few things are more agreeable than
to hear Romany spoken unexpectedly.&nbsp; Walking along a city
street, if suddenly amid the din of the traffic I hear a Gypsy
greeting, I experience a very pleasant emotion.</p>
<p>In passing along the Anlaby Road, I heard from behind me,
&ldquo;<i>S&acirc; shan</i>, <i>rashaia</i>?&rdquo; (How do,
parson?) and, looking round, I saw Mireli Heron&rsquo;s son, a
jovial, harum-scarum fellow who has found a permanent home in
Hull.&nbsp; I remember him as a travelling Gypsy, and his garb
was then characteristic and becoming, but he had now adopted a
coat, collar, and tie of the prevailing fashion.&nbsp; The Gypsy
of the town, I find, has no desire to attract attention to
himself; hence he becomes subdued in appearance, more&rsquo;s the
pity.&nbsp; Having settled, he becomes &ldquo;respectable,&rdquo;
drab-coloured, unpicturesque.</p>
<p>At my request young Heron walked across with me to the Spring
Bank, and on the way thither he pulled up at a photographers shop
window, and, pointing to a picture, asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you call that in <i>Romanes</i>?&rdquo;
(Gypsy).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a <i>kuskti-dik</i>in <i>rakli</i> (a good-looking
girl), to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Keka</i>, <i>keka</i> (no, no), I don&rsquo;t mean
that.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s our word for
&lsquo;picture&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dikamengri</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Keka</i>, that&rsquo;s the word for a
looking-glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what would <i>you</i> say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Stor-dui</i>-graph&rdquo;
(<i>Four</i>(4)-<i>two</i>(2)-graph, hence photograph).</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>The
Romany tongue is plastic, and a Gypsy will playfully coin new
words in this fashion.&nbsp; As a Gypsy once said,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always a way of saying a thing in
<i>Romanes</i>, if you can find it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; Certain it
is, if a Gypsy has no old word for a thing, he will not be long
in coining a new one.</p>
<p>Entering the Spring Bank Cemetery together, my companion
pointed out the grave of Yoki Shuri, the faithful consort of
Ryley Boswell (or Boss), and upon the neat stone I read this
inscription, &ldquo;In memory of Shorensey Boss, who died Jan.
18, 1868, aged 65 years.&rdquo;&nbsp; From a bush planted on the
grave I plucked a sweet white rose.</p>
<p>Further, I learned from my companion that Old Ryley&rsquo;s
son Isaac, commonly called &ldquo;Haggi,&rdquo; had died in Hull
only a few years previously.&nbsp; Like his brother Newton, he
too had visited Australia, and, returning to this country, had
settled in Hull, and was daily seen in the streets with a
grinding-barrow.&nbsp; A girl whom Haggi brought with him from
Australia told me (this was a few years later) that when as a
child she was naughty, Haggi would frighten her by saying,
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not good, Old Ryley will get you, and
he&rsquo;ll <i>maw tut</i>&rdquo; (kill you).</p>
<p>One summer, when holidaying with my family at the breezy
Yorkshire coast-town of Bridlington, I heard that there were
Romanies living in a house at a little inland town, and, cycling
over the hills, I spent a pleasant hour in the home of a Gypsy,
who in a sweet voice sang the following ballad:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>&ldquo;There were seven Gypsies all in a row,<br />
And they sang blithe and bonny, O!<br />
They sang until at last they came<br />
Unto the yellow castle&rsquo;s hall, O!</p>
<p>The yellow castle&rsquo;s lady, she came out,<br />
And gave to them some siller, O!<br />
She gave to them a far better thing,<br />
&rsquo;Twas the gold ring from her finger, O!</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock o&rsquo; night her lord came home,<br />
Enquiring for his lady, O!<br />
The waiting-maid gave this reply,<br />
She&rsquo;s gone with the roving Gypsies, O!</p>
<p>Come saddle me my milk-white steed,<br />
Come saddle for me my pony, O!<br />
That I may go by the green-wood side,<br />
Until I find my lady, O!</p>
<p>So all through the dark o&rsquo; night he rode,<br />
Until the next day&rsquo;s dawning, O!<br />
He rode along the green-wood side,<br />
And there he found his lady, O!</p>
<p>Last night you laid on a good feather bed,<br />
Beside your own married lord, O!<br />
To-night in the cold open fields you lie,<br />
Along with the roving Gypsies, O!</p>
<p>What made you leave your home and your lands?<br />
What made you leave your money, O!<br />
What made you leave your own married lord,<br />
To go with the roving Gypsies, O!</p>
<p>What cares I for my home and my lands,<br />
What cares I for my money, O!<br />
What cares I for my own married lord,<br />
I&rsquo;ll go with the roving Gypsies, O!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On leaving, I placed a silver coin in the singer&rsquo;s tawny
palm, whereupon she sprang from her stool by the fire and gave me
a resounding kiss on the cheek.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">WITH THE YORKSHIRE GYPSIES</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I have said, Gypsies settled in
houses now greatly outnumber their roving brethren.&nbsp; Hence
it has come to pass that nearly every town in the land possesses
a Bohemian quarter where you are met by dark faces and sidelong
glances speaking of Gypsy blood.&nbsp; Nor can the student of
Gypsy life and manners afford to neglect these haunts despite
their dinginess, for as often as not they contain aged Gypsies
whose memories are well worth ransacking for lore and legend, and
in &ldquo;working&rdquo; these queer alleys, one has often picked
up choice reminiscences of bygone Gypsy life.</p>

<p>One morning I was walking under the grey walls of Scarborough
Castle, and, coming out upon the sparkling North Bay, I ran into
the arms of a <i>mush-fakir</i> (umbrella-mender), who looked as
if there rolled in his veins a blend of Scottish and Irish blood,
but I was mistaken, for he told me he was Welsh and bore the name
of Evans.&nbsp; Far-travelled, his peregrinations had ranged from
Aberdeen to Penzance, and seldom have I met a man of his class so
overflowing with varied knowledge.&nbsp; He asked me if I <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>knew
William Street in Scarborough, but as a newcomer I admitted that
I had not so much as heard of the locality, and made request for
further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon William Street &rsquo;ll just suit you,&rdquo;
he declared.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s full o&rsquo; tinkers and
grinders, Gypsies and sweeps, and the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A regular Whitechapel,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve hit it,&rdquo; said he laughingly.</p>
<p>I asked him where he was residing in that street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the Model, to be sure, and if you ax for Long
Ambrose, you&rsquo;ll find they all know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I further inquired of him as to the Gypsy inhabitants of that
quarter, and he gave me a list of the &ldquo;travellers&rdquo;
who had settled there.&nbsp; These I called upon leisurely during
a holiday extending over three weeks.&nbsp; One day I would look
up one or two of them, and a few days later I renewed my
visitation by dropping in upon several others, and so on until
this little gold-mine was exhausted.</p>
<p>From the sea-front it was a change scarcely Aladdin-like to
find oneself in smoky William Street, a byway shut in by dingy
walls, which in the deepening dusk took on an air of
mystery.&nbsp; A little way down the street, I knocked at the
door of Inji Morrison, but as there was no response I lifted the
latch, and, putting my head inside the room, I spake aloud,
&ldquo;<i>Putsh man te av adr&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (Ask me to come
inside).&nbsp; A sound of shuffling feet was heard, with tripping
steps in the rear, and an old crone tottered forward, along with
her granddaughter, dark-eyed <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>and twenty-five.&nbsp; Following
them into the kitchen, I saw the floor scattered with willow pegs
in various stages of manufacture.&nbsp; The pair accorded me a
genial welcome, though they scanned me curiously as if wondering
what sort of Gypsy I might be.&nbsp; When I mentioned some black
foreign <i>Romanitshel</i>s whom I had seen, the old mother
remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to <i>dik lendi</i> (see them);
they would make me think of the <i>Beng</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as the old lady was dull of hearing, her granddaughter
(in an aside) said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind, <i>rai</i>, what granny says;
she&rsquo;s getting old.&nbsp; As for the <i>Beng</i>, there
ain&rsquo;t no sich pusson, I don&rsquo;t think.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s nothing bad comes from below.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
the springs we drink from, and the dearie little flowers we love
to gather.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s nothing but good comes from
above; the blessed sunshine and the light o&rsquo; moon and the
rain that falls&mdash;why, all of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s good things,
ain&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; The badness is on&rsquo;y what people
makes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now through the open door leading to a cramped backyard came a
hairy terrier, followed by a small boy with saucy eyes and long,
black curls falling upon the shoulders of his ill-fitting
coat.&nbsp; A great-grandson from a few doors lower down was this
quicksilver pixy, who sat himself at our feet and cuddled the
terrier near a few red embers in the grate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mend the fire, my gal,&rdquo; said Old Inji.&nbsp; And
when the wood blazed and lit up the room, granny <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>filled her
pipe from shavings cut from a cake of black tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never go to Seamer Fair no more now my
man&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely as I
could.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t be the same, would
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seamer Fair, when is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, next week.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be <i>dosta
Romanitshel</i>s <i>odoi</i> (many Gypsies there) and music and
dancing.&nbsp; Ay, and fighting too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she fell to rambling about her former life on the
road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Another day I sat with Vashti Boswell in her cottage down one
of the numerous yards branching out of William Street.&nbsp;
Handing me a rude stool, the work of some Gypsy carpenter, she
sat herself on the fender.&nbsp; On her forehead was a deep
indentation which she said was made by a blow from a poker at the
hand of a mad relative.&nbsp; In vivid words she described the
occasion of that blow, and one pictured the desperate struggle
between the two women, till Vashti, fainting from loss of blood,
fell in a heap on to the floor, but not before Izaria, a stalwart
fellow, attracted by his mother&rsquo;s screams, had rushed into
the house and snatched the weapon from the mad woman&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>A little higher up the street lived this same son and
Vashti&rsquo;s nephew, Joel Boswell, who were sent for, a
neighbour&rsquo;s child acting as messenger.&nbsp; I have often
noticed that Gypsies will call in their <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>kinsfolk
who live near to share in the pleasure and excitement, likewise
in the &ldquo;grist,&rdquo; implied by a <i>rai</i>&rsquo;s
visit.&nbsp; Much to my surprise Vashti knew all about Gypsy
Court at Lincoln, and little wonder when she presently told me
that her husband was a half-brother of my old friend, Jumping
Jack.</p>
<p>Talking of the past, Vashti declared that very few Gypsies in
her day went to church for marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man and me jumped the besom, we did.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s how we was married.&nbsp; Like many more, we
didn&rsquo;t get <i>parson&rsquo;d</i>, but we thought our old
way just as binding as if we&rsquo;d been to church.&nbsp; My man
were a good &rsquo;un as long as he lived, and weren&rsquo;t that
enough for the likes o&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you remember Jumping Jack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;wa</i> (yes), and he could jump too.&nbsp; He
once cleared the backs of three horses standing side by side, and
I&rsquo;s seen him jump the common gate times and agen.&nbsp;
When my husband was living, we used to travel Lincolnshire, and
now lots of us are living in houses scattered all over the
<i>tem</i>&rdquo; (country).</p>
<p>At this juncture, Joel disappeared for a few moments, and on
his return bore a large jug of foaming brown ale, which was his
way of welcoming the <i>rai</i>, and pipes were soon in full
blast.</p>
<p>It was from Joel&rsquo;s lips that I heard about Mordecai
Boswell, who died at Retford many years ago.&nbsp; Mordecai was a
fine-looking man, his hair falling in long curls.&nbsp; He wore a
dark green coat with big pearl buttons and a broad collar, while
his <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>low-crowned hat might well have been a family
heirloom.&nbsp; He had a dancing booth at fairs, and would
fiddle, while his sister Matilda danced and played the
tambourine.&nbsp; Frampton Boswell used to join him at the St.
Leger and other big races, and they didn&rsquo;t do badly with
the dancing booth.</p>
<p>One day a <i>gawjo</i> was chatting with Mordecai, and the
talk turned upon <i>hotshiwitshi</i> (hedgehog).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t fancy eating that creature,&rdquo;
said the <i>gawjo</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes me feel queer to
think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said Mordecai, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet
you a half-crown that before many days are past you&rsquo;ll have
had some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>gawjo</i> grinned and shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp;
Time went on, and the <i>gawjo</i> one day came upon Mordecai and
his family having dinner on the roadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you have a bite with us?&rdquo; said
Mordecai.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that on the dish?&rdquo; asked the
<i>gawjo</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duck,&rdquo; replied the Gypsy, with a grave
face.&nbsp; The <i>gawjo</i> sat down and was soon enjoying what
looked remarkably like a duck&rsquo;s leg.&nbsp; When the meal
was over and pipes were brought out, Mordecai got a-talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my pal, where have you been since I saw you last,
and how have you been faring?&nbsp; Has any Gypsy got you to
swallow a bit o&rsquo; <i>hotshiwitshi</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not likely.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t I tell you that that
nasty creature should never touch my lips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve done it to-day.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
had <i>hotshi</i> <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>for dinner, and you seemed to enjoy one of the legs
finely.&nbsp; You smacked your lips over it anyway.&nbsp; Hand up
that half-crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did so, and, turning pale, walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, <i>rai</i>,&rdquo; remarked Izaria, &ldquo;did
you know there&rsquo;s some of the black Herrens (Herons)
stopping at Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay, not far from here?&nbsp; I
seen &rsquo;em at Scarborough a little while back, and I
shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if some of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s at Seamer
Fair next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making a mental note of these two places, I resolved to visit
them.&nbsp; Then, happening to mention the <i>mush-fakir</i> whom
I had encountered near the Castle, Joel said, &ldquo;I once had
an uncle as was very fond of this here town, I mean Elisha
Blewitt, as married Mordecai&rsquo;s sister Sybarina; my uncle
was a <i>mush-fakir</i>, but he&rsquo;s been dead for
years.&nbsp; As for that there man you spoke of, I believe
there&rsquo;s a long-legged <i>g&egrave;ro</i> (man) in the same
line o&rsquo; business living at the Model.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day in the same quarter I waylaid Fennix Smith in company
with a Gypsy named Swales, who were about to set forth in a
two-wheeled cart drawn by a thin-legged pony, their destination
being Malton.&nbsp; On their way home they would call at
&ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Land,&rdquo; where they expected to find
some of their travelling friends drawing up for Seamer
Fair.&nbsp; Between their legs I noticed a lurcher curled up,
and, pointing to it, I said, &ldquo;I see you mean to have some
sport on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>&ldquo;Yes, and we shan&rsquo;t forget to bring you
some-think, pass&rsquo;n, if we has good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the pony-cart had rattled out of the street, I turned
into the yard of the Model, where several grinding-barrows stood
under a lean-to, but I failed to recognize Long Ambrose&rsquo;s
property among them, and, entering the house, I learned that my
<i>mush-fakir</i> might be expected home at any time.&nbsp;
Walking up the street, I came upon a stalwart Gypsy woman
standing at her open door.&nbsp; Her husband, I gathered, was a
tinker, and not a prosperous one at that, judging by his
wife&rsquo;s tattered gown and woebegone air.&nbsp; During our
talk about her relations who travelled Lincolnshire, two pretty
little children continually tugged at her gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go to Seamer Fair, <i>rai</i>, you&rsquo;ll be
sure to find some of my folks, the Smiths, along with the Herrens
and Youngs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then I heard a man whistling, and round the corner
appeared Long Ambrose pushing his barrow.&nbsp; In the yard of
the Model we conversed, and on his referring to Gloucester, I
asked if he knew any of the Carews, horse-dealers of that
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, there was one of them sold a dyed horse to
match a black carriage-<i>grai</i>, and a wery &lsquo;fly&rsquo;
cove he was, but he got found out, and had to do
&lsquo;time&rsquo; for that affair.&rdquo;&nbsp; My <i>mush-fakir
seemed</i> to have travelled everywhere.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mindful of the intimation let fall by Izaria Boswell <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>that there
were black Herons to be found at Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay, I made
my way thither afoot one brilliant July morning.&nbsp; A cool air
from the sea tempered the sun&rsquo;s powerful rays, and it was
good to inhale the sweetness of the summer meadows where the
haymakers were busy.&nbsp; Overhead the bent-winged silvery gulls
passed to and fro, and among the wayside bushes yellow-hammers
trilled their song which in childhood we translated by the words,
&ldquo;a little bit of bread and no cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perched on the top of a lofty cliff overlooking the North Sea,
the village of Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay seems almost to overhang a
precipice, and on stormy nights the wind roaring up the cliff
flings the salt spray far inland.&nbsp; The whole of the coast
hereabouts is a delicious panorama of rock-bound bays and
coves.</p>
<p>On arriving at the village I had no difficulty in locating my
Gypsies.&nbsp; A fisherman, sun-tanned and jovial, pointed a
stubby finger towards a grassy plot whereon stood three caravans,
and it was with a thrill of pleasure that I drew near.&nbsp; Yes,
there on the short turf sat one-armed Josh and Nettie, his
wife.&nbsp; Our greetings were hearty, and as we talked, up came
one of the Youngs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just the man I want to see,
<i>rashai</i>,&rdquo; and, taking out a crumpled newspaper, he
said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in here about stopping the
Gypsies from camping at Scarborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a hunt through the paper, I came upon a <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>report of a
meeting of the wiseacres of the town, and read their speeches
about the &ldquo;nuisances&rdquo; said to be created by the
Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there ain&rsquo;t any Gypsies there now
<i>we&rsquo;s</i> come away,&rdquo; said Young.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
people stopping there are only poor <i>didakai</i>s (half-breeds)
and <i>mumpari</i>.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t call <i>them</i>
Gypsies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was one of the purest-bred English Gypsies I have
ever met.</p>
<p>Pure Gypsies draw a marked line between dirty, low-class
van-dwellers and themselves; but unfortunately the world at large
makes no such distinction, immensely to the detriment of the true
<i>Romanitshel</i>.</p>
<p>East Yorkshire is a favourite country with the Herons and
Youngs.&nbsp; Both Josh and Nettie love it well, as did also some
of their forelders.&nbsp; It was at Robin Hood&rsquo;s Bay that
Nettie&rsquo;s Aunt Whipney died long years ago.&nbsp; I well
remember a little tale about this old Gypsy.&nbsp; Tinker Ned,
her husband, had &ldquo;found&rdquo; a <i>kani</i> (hen) for the
pot.&nbsp; It was a small one, and Whipney cooked it.&nbsp; When
the tinker came home at a later hour than he had promised, he
asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that <i>kani</i>?&nbsp; Have you cooked
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife answered by putting two fingers into her mouth,
meaning, that she had consumed the little fowl.&nbsp; Thereupon
Tinker Ned picked up a loose tent rod and gave her a good
thrashing.</p>
<p>Close by sat Nettie&rsquo;s daughter-in-law, Isabel, and her
children, bonny bairns, tumbled happily on the grass.&nbsp; As I
looked at these Gypsies, all of them <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>pictures of blooming
health&mdash;clear-eyed, clean-limbed, bare-headed in sun and
breeze&mdash;I reflected not without sadness on the fact that the
tendency of modern legislation is to curtail and render more
difficult the free, roving life of these children of Nature.</p>
<p>It was now late in the afternoon, and over tea we talked of
other times and old Gypsy ways.&nbsp; Nettie told of her own
mischievous tricks when she was a child, how she used to hide her
mammy&rsquo;s pipe in a tuft of grass near the tent, and then
watch her hunt up and down for it; her sister Linda and she would
have a good laugh to themselves over the trick, and then what
tales their old mother would tell them by the fire o&rsquo;
nights.&nbsp; One of these stories related to a horse belonging
to some Irish Gypsies, the O&rsquo;Neils.</p>
<p>He was an aged animal and a favourite of the family.&nbsp; One
day he fell down and broke his back.&nbsp; Quite still he lay,
and, taking him for dead, they removed his skin, but in the
morning he came and kicked at the <i>v&acirc;do</i>.&nbsp; He was
a sight awful to behold.&nbsp; Now it happened that near at hand
lay a pile of sheepskins, so they hurriedly clapped some of these
on the poor horse and bound them round and round with willow
withies.&nbsp; In a little while the animal recovered, and the
O&rsquo;Neils used to clip a crop of wool off him every
year.&nbsp; And since the willow sticks took root and grew, the
Gypsies were able to cut materials sufficient to make many
baskets.</p>
<p>Folk-stories of this character are classified by lorists as
&ldquo;lying tales,&rdquo; and in a subsequent chapter <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>I shall
give a sheaf of such stories familiar to all our Boswells and
Herons, wherever you may light upon them.</p>
<p>It was Nettie&rsquo;s daughter-in-law who, after listening to
a ghost tale from me, protested&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mulos</i> (ghosts)&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I
thinks about &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Folks who die and go to the good
place won&rsquo;t never want to leave it, and as for people what
go to the bad place, I reckons they&rsquo;ll have to stop
there.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t likely they&rsquo;ll ever have a
chance to come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking up the footpath leading to the camp, I saw
Isabel&rsquo;s little boy dragging a dead bough behind him.&nbsp;
Said Josh, waving his stump of an arm towards the approaching
child&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst thing we Gypsies does nowadays is to pick up
a dead stick or two for the fire, and if we goes into a
<i>wesh</i> (wood) for a little <i>shushi</i> (rabbit) for the
pot, well, I reckon there&rsquo;s plenty left for them as has a
deal too many.&nbsp; If we sets a snare, it ain&rsquo;t so cruel
as the keeper&rsquo;s teethy traps, and the lord and lady as
employs the keeper talks in the Town Hall agen cruelty to
animals&mdash;so I hear.&nbsp; Oh dear, it makes me
larf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I turned to take a farewell look at the group, I saw the
Gypsies stretched at full length, puffing their pipes, while away
beyond them lay the deep blue sea, and the rugged coast trending
north and south in exquisite bays.&nbsp; It was a sight to
cherish in the memory.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>A
cool rain in the early hours had given place to a hot July
morning, as I entered the village of Seamer already astir with
its horse-fair.&nbsp; Making my way between knots of colts and
droves of ponies at whose heels Gypsy boys were waving pink
glazed calico flags, I went to where one of the North-Country
Smiths stood gesticulating before a group of prospective buyers
of colts, and discovered in him Elias Petulengro&rsquo;s son,
Vanlo, whom I had known at Lincoln.&nbsp; Presently he walked
across to me and held out a hand of friendship.&nbsp; All around
us were Yorkshire travelling folk, and while chatting with Vanlo
I witnessed a curious thing.&nbsp; Three policemen stood talking
together, and one of them had his hands behind his back.&nbsp; A
Gypsy, sidling up, slipped a half-crown into this
policeman&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; I saw his fingers close over the
coin, yet he never by the slightest sign betrayed this act of the
Gypsy, which passed unobserved by the other constables.&nbsp;
Petulengro, who witnessed it, explained that this sort of thing
is not uncommon.&nbsp; It obtains little privileges.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The <i>muskro</i>&rdquo; (policeman), said he, &ldquo;will
turn a blind eye to that Gypsy&rsquo;s fire on some wayside
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Strolling through the fair, I spied old Clara Smith smoking a
black clay under a stone wall, and by her side sat her daughter
Tiena and one of her male relations, whom I had once met on a
bleak fell in North-West Yorkshire.&nbsp; It was he who told me
the following tale as he sat making pegs among the
ling:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>&ldquo;When I was a boy, I was taking <i>puvengri</i>s
(potatoes) from a field, and I looked up, and there stood a tall
man staring at me over the hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You come along with me,&rsquo; he shouted, and,
taking him for a policeman in plain clothes, I obeyed, and went
with him to a big building which I thought was the Sessions
House.&nbsp; There were many people inside, and a gentleman was
talking to them.&nbsp; At last he looked hard at me, and said,
&lsquo;Thou art the man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I jumped up and said, &lsquo;Yes, I know I am, but I
didn&rsquo;t mean to do it.&nbsp; It was my uncle as made me
go.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll never steal potatoes no more.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And because I would keep on talking like a Philadelphia lawyer,
they turned me out without passing sentence on me.&nbsp; Next day
I was walking with my uncle, and the tall man as took me off to
the place, passed by.&nbsp; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the policeman as
arrested me,&rsquo; says I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you silly boy,&rsquo; said my uncle,
&lsquo;that there man is the evangelist, and he took you to his
chapel, he did.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">It</span> ain&rsquo;t fit to turn a
dog out o&rsquo; doors, that it ain&rsquo;t, so you&rsquo;d
better make up your mind to stop all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saying this, Gypsy Ladin closed the porch door, but not
without difficulty, for a gale was battering upon the wayside
bungalow.&nbsp; Half an hour ago, as I hurried along the
willow-fringed &ldquo;ramper&rdquo; on my way to see this old
Romany pal, black rain-clouds, bulging low over the fenland
wapentake, had foretold an approaching storm; and now with the
descent of the May night the tempest had burst in full fury upon
the land.&nbsp; Torrential rain, swift swelling rushes of wind,
and brilliant flashes of lightning made me glad to be housed with
my friend in his fire-lit room.</p>
<p>Hidden by a dense hedge from the highway, this Gypsy abode
stood back amid a cluster of apple trees, and a daylight view of
the place would have revealed to you an entirely nondescript
habitation, with here a home-made porch, and there a
creeper-grown extension sheltering a green caravan in which Ladin
and his wife Juli have travelled many a mile over the smooth
causeways of the far-reaching flats.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Let
me picture for you the tiny apartment where we now sat happily
blowing clouds of tobacco smoke.&nbsp; Over the wide fireplace,
which occupied one side of the room, rose a high mantelpiece
surrounded by coloured prints of Derby winners, divided one from
another by glistening horse-bits and brass-bound whips.&nbsp;
Opposite the fireplace a small casement looked out upon a
bulb-garden aglow by day with hyacinths, tulips, and
narcissi&mdash;a common sight in the Fens.&nbsp; The side walls
were adorned with portraits of Gypsy relatives deceased and
living, and the brazen ornaments on parts of a van-horse&rsquo;s
harness gleamed in the rays of the pendant lamp.&nbsp; Before the
fire sat my friend and his wife, a tall, striking woman of the
old-fashioned Draper clan, and along with us were two youthful
sons of the house, Rinki and Zegul, smart, quick-eyed fellows,
who occupied a home-made bench opposite my seat of honour in the
chimney corner.&nbsp; At our feet lay a dark lurcher, a type of
dog whose peculiar qualities are well appreciated by Gypsies.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of my friend as &ldquo;Gypsy&rdquo;
Ladin, but his ruddy complexion and grey eyes are scarcely
suggestive of the pure Romany.&nbsp; About the good &ldquo;black
blood&rdquo; of his wife, however, there can be no manner of
doubt.&nbsp; Probably my friend would agree with the roving
<i>gawjo</i>, who, having married a pure Gypsy, declared that the
mingling of gentile and Romany crafts was a desirable blending of
qualities.&nbsp; Did not Lazzy Smith, renowned in Gypsydom, once
say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t it in the Bible that God&rsquo;s
people should multiply and be as one?&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t no
sort o&rsquo; use at all a-goin&rsquo; agen the dear blessed
Lord&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; Why, a cross is good, even if it be
only in wheat, ain&rsquo;t it, now?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belonging to East Anglia, Ladin&rsquo;s forelders have mingled
a good deal with the Herons who formerly travelled the counties
bordering upon the North Sea.&nbsp; Himself akin to the Chilcots
and Smiths, Ladin has inherited not a few traditions of these
families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember Yoki Shuri Smith?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean Old Ryley&rsquo;s wife?&nbsp; Ay, I mind her
well, but Ryley I don&rsquo;t remember.&nbsp;
Shuri&rdquo;&mdash;Ladin shivered as he uttered the
name&mdash;&ldquo;was looked upon as a <i>tshovihawni</i> (witch)
by our folks.&nbsp; We allus thought it unlucky to meet her on
the road of a morning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known my folks turn back,
saying, &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t no use going out
to-day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a discussion of Shuri&rsquo;s &ldquo;powers,&rdquo; I
ventured upon a tale of my own experience of a witch who lived in
a parish of which I was formerly curate-in-charge.</p>
<p>About a fortnight after my arrival at the Rectory, our aged
gardener took me into his confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me askin&rsquo; if you&rsquo;ve seen Old Betty
what lives agin the well at the bottom of the lane?&nbsp; You
must mind you don&rsquo;t never get across wi&rsquo; that woman,
or she&rsquo;ll sartinly mek things awk&rsquo;ard for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s meaning was that Betty had &ldquo;peculiar
powers.&rdquo;&nbsp; A widow of sixty or more, she attended <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>no place of
worship, and rarely covered her grey head with anything more than
a shawl.&nbsp; Besides her allowance from the parish, she managed
to make a little money by selling ointments for wounds and sores,
and many a cure has been wrought by means of her home-made
compounds.&nbsp; My first meeting with her was on the Feast of
St. Thomas, called in those parts &ldquo;Mumping
Day.&rdquo;&nbsp; At my door stood Old Betty asking for a bit of
silver, and a few yards behind her came several other
widows.&nbsp; Hesitatingly I stood just over the threshold, when
suddenly, before I could step aside, a lot of soft snow slid from
the house-roof with a splash upon my bare head, while Old Betty
and her companions laughed loud and long.&nbsp; The village
gossips duly spread it abroad that Betty had, by her
&ldquo;peculiar powers,&rdquo; brought down the snow upon the
parson&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; Anyway, I resolved for the future to
be more prompt in the exercise of that unfailing charm against
Betty&rsquo;s witchcraft&mdash;a silver shilling.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see my Aunt Sarah at Blackpool?&rdquo;
said Juli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I once had tea in her tent on the South
Shore.&nbsp; Did she and her <i>rom</i> (husband), Edward, ever
travel on this side of England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sartinly, they did.&nbsp; Ned&rsquo;s daddy, Tyso, lies
buried in your country.&nbsp; Poor old man, many&rsquo;s the time
I&rsquo;ve heard the tale about him and the shepherd
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tyso was once <i>hatsh</i>in (camping) on a
Norfolk common and got a-talking with a boy tending sheep.&nbsp;
Says the boy to Tyso&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I can tell you where there&rsquo;s a buried box
full o&rsquo; money.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Show me the place,&rsquo; says Tyso.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy took him to a little low, green hill, and then
they fetches a spade and digs into it.&nbsp; Sure enough they
bared the lid of an old iron chest with a ring on top, and both
of &rsquo;em tugged hard at the ring, but the box wouldn&rsquo;t
budge an inch.&nbsp; Just then Tyso swore, and the ring slipped
outen their hands, and down went the box and they never
see&rsquo;d it no more.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;One time the Herrens (Herons) used to come about here a
good deal.&nbsp; There was handsome William, a wery notified man
he were.&nbsp; Then there was Old Niabai and Crowy.&nbsp; Their
son Isaac had a boy born at Lynn close by here&mdash;that was
&Icirc;za.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll know him sure-ly.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
often met Ike&rsquo;s half-brother Manful in Lynn.&nbsp; I can
see him now, a little doubled-up old man.&nbsp; I &rsquo;spects
you&rsquo;s heard tell of Manful&rsquo;s diamond?&nbsp; One day
in a public, he catch&rsquo;d sight of something shining among
the sand&mdash;they sanded the slab floors in them
days&mdash;and, whatever the thing was, it shone like a bit of
cut-glass, and at first he thought it wasn&rsquo;t worth stooping
for, but when the taproom was empty he picked it up, and <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span><i>dawdi</i>! if it wasn&rsquo;t a diamond as big as a
cobnut.&nbsp; So away he takes it to a pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop,
and the head man told him it were worth hundreds of pounds.&nbsp;
My dear old dad once saw it with his own eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>While the black trees shuddered outside in the tempest, Ladin
next told a story I shall never forget.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;When my uncle, Alfred Herren, and his wife Becky was
a-travelling in Shropshire, they draw&rsquo;d their wagon one
night into a by-lane&mdash;so they thought&mdash;just outside the
village, but daylight show&rsquo;d &rsquo;em it were a
gentleman&rsquo;s drive leading up to a red mansion among the
trees.&nbsp; Did my uncle pull out when he found he&rsquo;d made
a mistake?&nbsp; No, for a wery good reason he stopped where he
was.&nbsp; His missis had been took ill in the night, and a
little gell were born.&nbsp; The doctor gave no hopes at all for
the wife, and just when things looked blackest, a groom on
horseback came up from the mansion, and, slamming on the
wagon-side with his whipstock, shouted&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Clear out of here, you rascally Gypsies, afore
my master sees you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Alfred put his head outen the door, and
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Stop it, my man.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a woman
a-dying in here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d take it kind of you to go to the
big house yonder and ask the good lady to come and pray by a
dying Gypsy.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>&ldquo;Off goes the groom with the message, and soon
the squire&rsquo;s lady come along carrying a basket of good
things, and did all she could for Becky, but the poor thing
died.&nbsp; After that the parson came to christen the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What name?&rsquo; he asks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Flower o&rsquo; May,&rsquo; says my uncle.&nbsp;
The wagon stood under a may-tree, and the flowers were dropping
on the grass like snow.&nbsp; Now, the squire and his lady come
along.&nbsp; Says he&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Almighty has never given us the blessing of
a child, so we would like to adopt this little girl of yours and
bring her up as our own.&nbsp; Here&rsquo; (holding up a bag)
&lsquo;are one hundred sovereigns.&nbsp; Take them, my good man,
and let us have the baby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; says my uncle, &lsquo;you may keep
your bag of gold.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t never part wi&rsquo; my
little gell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years went by, and at last my uncle fell ill and
died.&nbsp; Then my own parents took care of the little gell, and
they changed her name to Rodi, for they couldn&rsquo;t abide to
hear the name Flower o&rsquo; May no more; it reminded &rsquo;em
too sadly of them as had gone.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On arising from my couch next morning, it was a pleasure to
find that the air was moderately quiet, and patches of blue were
showing between the rolling clouds.&nbsp; Breakfast over, my
friends showed me round their garden gay with flowering
bulbs.&nbsp; Gypsy-like, they had numerous pets&mdash;a pair of
long-eared owls, <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>a jackdaw, a goldfinch, some dainty bantams, and two or
three pheasants in a wired poultry-run.&nbsp; Now the Gypsies
came as far as the highway to see me off.&nbsp; Tender leaves and
twigs strewed the road, as I mounted my bicycle, and after
pedalling through several villages, the roofs of King&rsquo;s
Lynn began to appear ahead.&nbsp; A turn in the road at last
brought me to a bridge spanning the broad river Ouse discoloured
by flood-water.&nbsp; In a yard of the tavern just across the
river, the chimneys of several Gypsy vans were to be seen.&nbsp;
I therefore dismounted to make inquiries.&nbsp; Sunning himself
on a bench outside the inn, sat a tall Gypsy man emptying a mug
of Norfolk ale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&acirc; shan</i>, <i>baw</i>?&rdquo; (How do,
mate?) said I, sitting down beside him.&nbsp; He turned out to be
one of the Kilthorpes, and his pals in the yard were Coopers from
London.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>An hour or two later, as I was loitering at a street corner in
Lynn, I observed not far away a two-wheeled hooded cart drawn by
a tired horse.&nbsp; From under a dark archway they emerged, and,
coming into the light, I noticed an old woman under the hood
smoking a pipe, and just then, from behind the cart stepped a
sweep, who disappeared into a coal-yard, carrying a sack in his
hand.&nbsp; Following him, I heard him say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a hundred-weight, missis.&rdquo;&nbsp; A burly
woman, having weighed out the coal, poured it into the
sack&mdash;<a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>a bottomless receptacle&mdash;and the black lumps were
scattered about the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muk man peser</i>&rdquo; (Let me pay), said I, from
behind the sweep.&nbsp; Whereupon the grimy old fellow looked
round with an amazed stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pariko tuti</i>, <i>rai</i>&rdquo; (Thank you, sir),
he stammered out, and, producing a piece of string, he tied the
sack bottom securely, and the two of us picked up the littered
coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you living?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pawdel</i> the <i>p&acirc;ni</i>&rdquo; (Across the
water) &ldquo;in West Lynn.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been away for three
months, and we&rsquo;re going round to our house now.&nbsp; Come
across to-night.&nbsp; Anybody will tell you where Old Stivven
lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the yellow street-lamps were twinkling in the dusk, I
groped my way down a long dark passage, and at the foot of a
flight of slippery wet steps, found a black coble moored.&nbsp;
For ten minutes or so I waited till a man in a jersey appeared
and rowed me across the broad, rolling Ouse.&nbsp; At the
&ldquo;White Swan&rdquo; inn I made inquiry for my sweep, and was
given an address, and discovered a sweep, but, alas, he
wasn&rsquo;t my man at all, and I began to think Old Stephen had
tricked me.&nbsp; But now I was given another address, where I
found my man and his wife in their living-room, amid a spread of
blankets and bedding airing in front of a bright fire.&nbsp; For
a while we talked, and then at the sweep&rsquo;s suggestion we
moved across to the &ldquo;White Swan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Stephen had formerly travelled with Barney Mace, an
uncle of Jem, the world-famed pugilist, who had a boxing booth
which he took to country fairs up and down the land, and in order
to <i>t&acirc;der</i> the <i>gawj&ecirc;</i> (draw the gentiles),
Stephen and Poley (Barney&rsquo;s son) would engage in a few
rounds just outside the booth.</p>
<p>The sweep had known Old &#332;seri Gray, commonly called
&ldquo;Sore-eyed Horsery,&rdquo; who died some years ago at
King&rsquo;s Lynn.&nbsp; He was a renowned Gypsy fiddler.&nbsp;
If he heard a band play a tune, he would go home and reproduce
the air on his violin, putting in such variations, grace-notes,
shakes, and runs, that none of his fellows could compare with
him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among the sweep&rsquo;s reminiscences was a curious story
about an eccentric Gypsy who had a fancy for carrying his coffin
in his travelling van.&nbsp; The man had a daughter, a grown
woman, who went about with him, his wife having died some years
before.&nbsp; One afternoon while she was away with her basket in
the village, her father took out the coffin and was busy
repainting it when a thunderstorm descended.&nbsp; The Gypsy took
shelter in his <i>v&acirc;do</i>, which was drawn up near an elm
tree on a bit of a common.&nbsp; Picture the grief and dismay of
his daughter on returning to find her father a corpse, for a
flash of lightning had struck the tree and the van and killed the
old Romany.&nbsp; On the day of the Gypsy&rsquo;s funeral, the
vicar of the parish had the flag flying half-mast high <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>on the
church tower, which everybody said was a kindly feeling to show
for one who was only a wandering Gypsy.</p>
<p>On asking my sweep about the house-dwelling Gypsies of Lynn,
he directed me to the abode of the aged widow of Louis Boss (son
of the famous Ryley Boswell or Boss), and a charming reception
she gave me in her spotless cottage in a retired court.&nbsp; The
sweep had told me of this old lady&rsquo;s liking for snuff, and
a visit to a <i>tuvalo budika</i> (tobacco shop) enabled me to
give her a little pleasure.&nbsp; By the fireside she refilled
her shiny metal box, and, having offered me a trial of the
pungent dust, herself took deep, loving pinches, with the air of
a connoisseur.&nbsp; Indeed, the snuff cemented our friendship
forthwith.&nbsp; Here I am reminded of a story telling how Dr.
Manning (of the Religious Tract Society) once employed snuff in a
very different fashion.&nbsp; When visiting Granada in Spain, he
was beset by a begging crew of swarthy men, women, and children,
and as he stood in the middle of the clamouring horde, he took
out his snuff-box.&nbsp; Immediately all the Gypsies wanted a
pinch.&nbsp; He obliged them, so long as the snuff lasted, taking
care to keep a tight hold of his silver box.&nbsp; Soon the
Gypsies were all sneezing and laughing immoderately, and amid the
commotion the good doctor managed to make his escape.</p>
<p>The road from King&rsquo;s Lynn to East Dereham led me through
villages astir with Whitsuntide festivities.&nbsp; At one point I
turned down a by-lane, <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>and, resting at the foot of a tree
within view of Borrow&rsquo;s birthplace at Dumpling Green, I
observed a party of donkey-folk trudging along with their animals
towards Dereham.&nbsp; Local mumpers were these people, a
draggle-tailed lot, and I could not help reflecting upon the
difference between the poor wanderers who now pass for Gypsies
and the Petulengros and Herons of Borrow&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>In the church of East Dereham, one&rsquo;s fancy pictured the
boy Borrow in the corner of a pew fixing his eyes upon the
dignified rector and parish clerk &ldquo;from whose lips would
roll many a portentous word descriptive of the wondrous works of
the Most High.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like living in <i>Lavengro</i> to wander about the
alleys and lanes of old Norwich and through the ling and fern on
breezy Mousehold above the town.&nbsp; Up there amid the camping
sites and the fighting-pits, it was not without sadness that I
read on a notice-board&mdash;&ldquo;No Gypsy, squatter, or
vagrant shall frequent, or resort to, or remain upon the
Heath.&rdquo;&nbsp; O shades of Jasper Petulengro and Tawno
Chikno, changed indeed are the times since the days when ye loved
and fought and trafficked within the precincts of beautiful old
Norwich!</p>
<p>Concerning my trip by boat from Yarmouth to London, which was
entirely lacking in Gypsy interest, nothing need be said
here.</p>
<p>London is in parts strongly tinctured with Gypsy <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>blood.&nbsp; Let anyone walk along the streets which
have been built upon the sites of the old metropolitan Gypsyries,
and he will surely see dark faces and black eyes telling how the
Gypsies still cling to these localities.&nbsp; All around Latimer
Road Station, which stands upon the Potteries, Gypsies are to be
found living in narrow courts and dingy lanes.</p>
<p>On my way to Epsom on the eve of the Derby, I passed a few
happy moments with my aged pal, Robert Petulengro, in whose back
room at Notting Hill I have often been regaled with racy stories
and touching reminiscences of old-time Romany life.&nbsp; There
is something suggestive of the cleric in Bob&rsquo;s demeanour,
and a stranger would never suspect that my placid-looking friend
had led a wild, roving life.&nbsp; It is when he loses himself in
a tale that his mild ministerial air gives place to a vivacity
characteristically Gypsy.</p>
<p>To the Gypsyry on the Potteries came nomads named Heron and
Leatherlund in the year 1854.&nbsp; (Some of their descendants
still reside at the backs of the mews in Notting Hill.)&nbsp;
They were the survivors of a sad disaster which in the previous
year had befallen a party of hop-pickers at Hadlow in Kent.&nbsp;
Through the kindness of a Gypsy woman who was &ldquo;saved from
the flood,&rdquo; I am able to reprint a portion of an old tract
giving the Rev. R. Shindler&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;The Medway
Disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Kent you may still be told of a sad <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>catastrophe
which befel a party of hop-pickers, in the year 1853, as they
were returning to their temporary habitations after a day&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; The scene of the alarming event was in the parish of
Hadlow, near Tunbridge, Kent.&nbsp; It is well known that
thousands of poor people flock down into Kent for the
hopping.&nbsp; Some of these are Gypsies; some may be described
as house-cart people, who travel from place to place for the
greater part of the year, selling their wares&mdash;brushes and
brooms, tin-ware, earthen-ware, and such-like; but by far the
larger part emerge from the lanes and alleys and courts of
London.&nbsp; To the last especially, but to the others also, the
hopping proves, when the weather is fine and the hops good, a
pleasant recreation as well as a profitable employment.&nbsp; A
number of people of Gypsy character and habits were employed by a
farmer who resided in the parish of Tudely, and who had hop
gardens also in Hadlow parish.&nbsp; It is a good rule among the
hop-farmers, that when their gardens are any considerable
distance from the homes of the natives or the encampments of the
strangers, the pickers should be conveyed in wagons to and from
the gardens.&nbsp; In this case, the river Medway had to be
crossed in going to and from the gardens, and the only means of
crossing was a wooden bridge of considerable span, and high above
the current.&nbsp; The bridge was considered dangerous,
especially for spirited horses, who were alarmed at the noise <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>made by
their own feet.&nbsp; The bridge was rendered even more dangerous
by reason of the rather frail open wooden rails which flanked it
right and left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the morning of the day on which the catastrophe
occurred, several parties passed over the bridge in safety, and
in the evening parties of natives, or
&lsquo;home-dwellers,&rsquo; had returned without any mishap; but
as a party of Gypsies and suchlike were being conveyed back, the
horses suddenly took fright, ran the wagon against the side of
the bridge, which gave way, and wagon, horses, and people were
precipitated into the strong current below, and no less than
thirty were drowned.&nbsp; I was then pastor in a neighbouring
parish, and had taken a deep interest in the religious condition
of the hoppers, preaching in fields and stackyards and elsewhere
near their encampments, and distributing tracts and New
Testaments.&nbsp; The sad event mentioned above stirred my heart
a great deal, and I felt impelled to write a short tract.&nbsp;
The thirty hop-pickers were buried in Hadlow churchyard in a
common grave, the spot being marked by a monument recording the
names of those who perished in the waters of the
Medway.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are in Battersea numerous &ldquo;yards&rdquo; under
railway arches, where living-vans of &ldquo;travellers&rdquo;
used to be seen all the year round.&nbsp; Very much diluted is
the Gypsy blood to be found nowadays in these
&ldquo;yards.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is these degenerates, mostly <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Londoners
bred and born, who at times give so much trouble to the local
authorities in Surrey.</p>
<p>Upon Hampstead Heath, and at Wormwood Scrubbs, a sprinkling of
Gypsy faces may be seen among the show-folk on a Bank Holiday,
and at Edmonton, Mitcham, and near Southend-on-Sea, I have met
Gypsies all the year round.</p>
<p>If the Yorkshireman goes to see the St. Leger because he has
an instinctive love of horse-flesh, the Cockney resorts to Epsom
Downs on the Derby Day to smell the scent of green turf and to
take part in the most stupendous picnic in the world.</p>
<p>Not merely to see a crowd of nearly a million human beings,
but to sample Epsom&rsquo;s Gypsies, was the object of my visit
to the Downs one unforgettable June day.&nbsp; London&rsquo;s
unyielding pavements mean for me, after a day or two of them, an
unpleasant foot-soreness, hence it was a relief to step forth
upon the springy sward outside the Downs Station.&nbsp; Like
children let loose from school, my fellow-travellers from town
laughed and joked, whistled and sang, as briskly they moved
towards the course.</p>
<p>It was among the gorse bushes on the sunlit hilltop that I
caught my first glimpse of the Gypsies, and to one acquainted
with the swart <i>Romanitshel</i>s of East Anglia and the
Northern Counties, the folk of the ramshackle carts and tiny
tents were distinctly disappointing.&nbsp; Ruddy, fair-haired,
and poorly-clad, were many of them; what a falling off <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>from the
horde of dark Gypsies assembled at some of our North-Country
fairs!</p>
<p>While I was chatting with a metropolitan policeman, up came a
tall Gypsy girl vending what purported to be tiny squares of
cedar wood, though the specimen I purchased for threepence
smelled a good deal more like the innermost layer of the red bark
abounding in the strips of pine forest around Tunbridge
Wells.&nbsp; When I inquired of the damsel as to what Gypsies
were present on the Downs, she replied, with a low laugh,
&ldquo;You&rsquo;s never got to go far in these parts for to
catch an Ayre.&nbsp; My dad&rsquo;s an Ayre, but my <i>dai</i>
(mother) was a Stevens.&nbsp; Over there&rdquo; (pointing to a
town of Gypsy caravans and a country fair combined opposite the
Grand Stand) &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find some of the Matthews,
Penfolds, and maybe a few of the Bucklands.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Crossing the course, I made my way to the part of the Downs
indicated by Cinderella Ayre, and though I rubbed shoulders with
a good many sunburnt travellers in corduroys, and show-women in
gowns of red and green, the first real Gypsy it was my good
fortune to meet was Davy Lee, the ancient vagabond who
&ldquo;planted&rdquo; the <i>duker</i>in-<i>mokto</i>
(fortune-telling box) upon George Smith of Coalville.&nbsp;
Although nearly blind, Davy managed to dodge in and out of the
crowd, and, taking me up to his wagon, found time to chat about
his father, the renowned Zacky Lee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daddy was stopping one night in a field, and before
going to bed, he looked out and there <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>was his white donkey&mdash;leastways
so he fancied.&nbsp; It was roaming about, and he set off to
catch and tether it, so as he shouldn&rsquo;t lose it.&nbsp; But
do whatever he would, he could never get up to the animal.&nbsp;
The nearer he tried to come at it, the furder off it allus was,
till at last he know&rsquo;d that what he&rsquo;d been chasing
all night was not his donkey at all, but the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lounging on the grass, I noticed that the great event of the
afternoon had arrived.&nbsp; Sleek, lean horses cantered along
the course and passed out of sight.&nbsp; Amid a confused hubbub
of voices, several moments went by.&nbsp; Now the glasses were
levelled, and a profound silence settled on the crowd.&nbsp; All
eyes were turned upon a little knot of horses appearing round
Tattenham Corner.&nbsp; Then the sound of many voices swelled
into a roar and died down again when the numbers went up.</p>
<p>Prominent at these races in days gone by was Matthias Cooper,
a Gypsy to whom the late King Edward, when Prince of Wales, would
toss a golden sovereign.&nbsp; A well-known figure was Matty,
attired in white hat, yellow waistcoat, black cut-away coat, and
white trousers.&nbsp; Hovering about this old Gypsy was an air of
the Courts and the Wilderness, for had he not mingled with
royalty nearly all his life, this old &ldquo;Windsor
Froggie&rdquo;?&nbsp; It was from him that Charles G. Leland
obtained most of the materials that went to make his work
entitled <i>The English Gipsies and their Language</i>.&nbsp;
Matty is now no more, but his <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>sons, Anselo and Wacker, still
attend the Epsom races year by year.</p>
<p>The great carnival was at last subsiding when I found myself
in the tent of Anselo Cooper and his wife, with whom I took
tea.&nbsp; I am not likely to forget my ride from the course to
Epsom Town.&nbsp; As the Coopers were not leaving till the end of
the week, they begged a lift for me from some friends of theirs
who were going to the town.&nbsp; Our &ldquo;carriage,&rdquo; a
two-wheeled affair, was drawn by a gaunt, long-legged horse, and
along with some strange dark Gypsies I sat upon a pile of smoky
tent-covers.&nbsp; We sped along the Down-land in a fashion which
rocked us terribly.&nbsp; The very policemen laughed as we went
by, but we reached the town in safety.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">TINKERS AND GRINDERS</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="GutSmall">PLAGUE</span> of an incline to joints
stiffened by age, the Steep Hill at Lincoln is for me aureoled by
all the fair colours of youth.&nbsp; Have I not more than once
rent my nether garments in gliding down the adjacent
hand-rail?&nbsp; Likewise in the time of snow have I not, defiant
of police-notices, made slides where the gradient is
sharpest?</p>
<p>Now it happened one day that under the shadow of the ancient,
timbered houses just below the crown of the hill there stood at
his workshop on wheels a Gypsy tinker whose wizened figure and
general air of queerness would have charmed a Teniers, and I, a
town boy with no small capacity for prying, hovered at his elbow,
studying his operations.&nbsp; Suz-z-z-z-z went the
tinker&rsquo;s wheel, as the sparks scattered in a rosy shower
from the edge of a deftly handled blade.&nbsp; Then of a sudden
something happened, causing me to jump as one who had been
shot.&nbsp; There was a dull thud of a falling body, followed
immediately by a shrill cry issuing from the throat of a
sprawling pedlar&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop my leg, stop my leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>A
glance at the poor fellow revealed the whole story.&nbsp; His
wooden leg, having become detached from its moorings, was rolling
down the paved incline.&nbsp; Several persons were passing at the
time, and more than one made a dash to recover the defaulting
limb, but, youth&rsquo;s suppleness favouring me, I managed to
capture the elusive treasure, and up the hill I bore it in
triumph.&nbsp; With admirable agility the tinker reattached the
limb, and the pedlar went on his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme yer knife, boy,&rdquo; said the tinker.</p>
<p>I had one resembling a saw, which he whisked from my hand and
duly restored with a nice edge.&nbsp; He then resumed his work as
though nothing worthy of remark had happened to stay the song of
his wheel.</p>
<p>A craft of hoary antiquity is that of the nomad
metal-worker.&nbsp; An Austrian ecclesiastic, in the year 1200,
describes the &ldquo;calderari,&rdquo; or tinkers, of that time:
&ldquo;They have no home or country.&nbsp; Everywhere they are
found alike.&nbsp; They travel through the world abusing mankind
with their knavery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four hundred years later, an Italian writer gives an account
of the tinker who enchants the knives of the peasants by
magnetizing them so as to pick up needles, and for this he
accepts payment in the shape of a fowl or a pie.&nbsp; To this
day in Eastern Europe, the smith, usually a Gypsy, is regarded as
a semi-conjurer who has dealings with the Devil.</p>
<p>In Scotland you will find numberless &ldquo;Creenies, <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>crinks, and
tinklers&rdquo; who roam in primitive Gypsy fashion, with
donkeys, ramshackle carts, tents, and a tinker&rsquo;s
equipment.&nbsp; If you have dropped into the shepherd&rsquo;s
cottage in the heathery glen, or the lone farmhouse on the
Lowland fell, you will have noticed the horn spoons and ladles,
or the rude smoothing-irons.&nbsp; These are the handiwork of the
tinklers of a bygone generation.</p>
<p>Two or three generations ago most of our English Gypsies were
wandering tinkers carrying their outfits on their backs.</p>
<p>For my own part, I have everywhere found the caste of tinkers
a cheerful, happy-go-lucky fellowship, and in talks with them I
have observed that they generally know a few Gypsy words, even
when it is clear that they do not belong to the dark race.</p>
<p>Shakespeare&rsquo;s Prince Hal, in <i>Henry </i><span
class="GutSmall"><i>IV</i></span>. (First Part, Act 2, Scene 4),
is made to say, &ldquo;I can drink with any tinker in his own
language.&rdquo;&nbsp; This language, or jargon, known as
<i>Shelta</i>, <a name="citation207"></a><a href="#footnote207"
class="citation">[207]</a> has been the subject of much learned
writing.</p>
<p>My first lesson in Shelta was taken near the Shire Bridge,
where the Great North Road, approaching Newark-on-Trent from the
south, quits Lincolnshire <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>for the county of Nottingham.&nbsp;
A favourite halting-place is this for wayfaring folk of all
sorts.&nbsp; Seated on Mother Earth&rsquo;s green carpet, a
tinker and his wife were taking tea, and at their invitation I
sat beside them for a chat.&nbsp; Presently I showed two bright
new pennies to the tinker, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll tell me what these are in
<i>Shelta</i>, they&rsquo;re yours.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>In a moment he replied, &ldquo;<i>Od nyok</i>&rdquo; (two
heads), and I handed over the coins.&nbsp; With a comic gesture
he queried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer wouldn&rsquo;t like to larn a bit more o&rsquo;
thet langwidge, would yer?&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Rat-tat-tat&rdquo; went the old brass knocker one
morning at the side-door of my house, and on being informed that
a tinker was inquiring for me, I hastened to see what manner of
man he was.&nbsp; Before me stood a battered specimen of the
Romany of the roads, and with a view to testing his depth, I
asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you ever <i>dik</i> any <i>Romanitshel</i>s on the
<i>drom</i>?&rdquo; (see any Gypsies on the road).</p>
<p>&ldquo;You &rsquo;ave me there, mister,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Upon my soul, I dunno what you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo;
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>The
man&rsquo;s face was a study in innocence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know right enough what I&rsquo;m saying,&rdquo; I
continued in Romany.</p>
<p>My man could endure it no longer, and, exploding with mirth,
he turned and shouted to his brother, who stood near a
grinding-barrow on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Av akai</i>, Bill, &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a <i>rashai
roker</i>in <i>Romanes</i> as fast as we can&rdquo; (Come here,
Bill, here&rsquo;s a parson talking Gypsy).&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring
that <i>shushi</i> (rabbit) out o&rsquo; the <i>guno</i>&rdquo;
(sack).</p>
<p>With unaffected goodwill, the two Gypsies insisted on my
accepting the rabbit as a token of friendship.&nbsp; This I did
gladly, asking no questions as to how they had come by a
newly-killed rabbit.&nbsp; After grinding my garden axe, they
both set off whistling down the road.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One day a Gypsy tinker, whom I had met a few times, took me
aside, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sister lives in the next street&rdquo; (he told me
the number).&nbsp; &ldquo;She has a pony, a poor, scraggy thing,
which she wants to get rid of badly.&nbsp; Go you and say to
her&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I hear you have a nice little cob to
sell.&rsquo;&nbsp; And when she brings it round for you to look
at, say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bless my soul, do you think I&rsquo;d buy a
hoppy <i>grai</i> like <i>dova</i>?&rsquo;&rdquo; (a lame horse
like that).</p>
<p>Presently, at that sister&rsquo;s threshold, I waited for the
pony to be brought round, which on arriving proved to be a
miserable-looking animal indeed.&nbsp; The <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>woman
looked first at me, then at the pony, which limped badly, while
its bones showed through its skin.</p>
<p>Said I, &ldquo;Well, really, I didn&rsquo;t expect to see
quite such a <i>wafodu kova</i>&rdquo; (wretched thing).</p>
<p>Readily entering into the joke, she laughed heartily.&nbsp;
She had taken me for a <i>dinelo gawjo</i> (gentile simpleton),
and to her astonishment I had turned out to be a Gypsy of a
higher sort.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At one time I used to have frequent visits from a travelling
tinker, and when his grinding-barrow was standing in my yard, I
would chat with him while he was doing some little job.&nbsp; He
was an interesting fellow who had seen something of the
world.&nbsp; He had a remarkable knowledge of the medicinal
properties of wild herbs, and would spend hours by the chalk
stream in our valley, grubbing up liverwort of which he would
make decoctions.&nbsp; One morning he was in the tale-telling
mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this very barrer what you&rsquo;re looking at
now.&nbsp; You notice there&rsquo;s lots of bits of brass nailed
on it for to catch the sunshine.&nbsp; I likes my barrer to look
cheerful.&nbsp; Well, there was a fellow came to me with summut
wrapped up in brown paper, a flat thing it was, and he says,
&lsquo;I want you to buy this here off me.&rsquo;&nbsp; Says I,
&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at it,&rsquo; and when he opened
it out, it was a fine bit of copper-plate with summut engraved on
it.&nbsp; I asked him what the engraving was about, for you know
I can&rsquo;t read.&nbsp; He says, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s an architex
business plate, that&rsquo;s <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>all, and you can have it for a
shilling.&rsquo;&nbsp; So I bought it and nailed it on to my
barrer among the other bits of brass and things.&nbsp; Well,
happens that a parson was a-talking to me one day, and I noticed
his eye lighted on this here copper-plate.&nbsp; Says he, looking
wery serious, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this will get you into
trouble, if a policeman sees it.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;How&rsquo;s
that?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the
copper-plate?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says he,
&lsquo;it&rsquo;s a plate for printing &pound;5 notes.&nbsp;
Where did you get it from?&rsquo;&nbsp; And I told him.&nbsp; You
may be sure I soon had that plate off my barrer, and, turning to
the parson, I says, &lsquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;ll buy it off me,
for a sort of nicknack?&rsquo;&nbsp; And he gave me half-a-crown
for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking slyly at me, the tinker remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that parson got home, being a man of eddication,
he would know where to get the right sort of paper, and then he
would make &pound;5 notes cheap, you bet.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For several Christmas Eves past, this tinker&rsquo;s boy and a
little pal have walked some miles from a neighbouring town to
sing carols at my Rectory door.&nbsp; They possess good voices
and sing very tunefully some of the old carols, &ldquo;God rest
you, merry gentlemen,&rdquo; and the like.</p>
<p>One summer afternoon, in the market-place at Hull, I met two
grinders coming out of a tavern, near which stood a
tinker&rsquo;s barrow belonging to one of them, Golias Gray, a
Gypsy, whom I had seen <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>before at fair-times in the seaport
town.&nbsp; &ldquo;Black as the ace of spades&rdquo; is Golias,
and he was, as usual, sporting a yellow shirt.&nbsp; His
pale-faced companion, a stranger to me, after a little talk,
waxed communicative, and, whilst his Gypsy pal resumed his
grinding of knives, he gave me a short list of words in
<i>Shelta</i> (Tinker&rsquo;s Talk).</p>

213</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE INN ON THE RIDGEWAY&mdash;TALES BY THE
FIRESIDE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> one time I had a great liking
for long jaunts in search of fossils&mdash;cross-country rambles
extending over two or three days.&nbsp; Thus I came to know many
a deserted quarry and unfrequented byway of our county, as well
as the bedchambers of sundry remote wayside
inns&mdash;&ldquo;hedge-taverns,&rdquo; perhaps some would have
described these lonely little houses of call.&nbsp; Occasionally,
however, I lighted upon an inn which had seen better days, a
sleepy old house with mullioned casements, a worn mounting-block
of stone, and a rude iron ring still fixed in the wall near the
deep porch before which an unfenced stretch of sward dipped
towards the roadway.</p>
<p>Let me recall one of my geologizing expeditions on an early
March day.&nbsp; I had been successful in my quest, and my
knapsack, laden with stony spoils, was not very light.&nbsp; But
what matter?&nbsp; It was fine to be striding along a ridgeway
with a roaring gale behind, and every wayside tree whistling like
a ships rigging in a storm.&nbsp; Going along that road, <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I stretched
out my limbs, and in so doing the very thews and sinews of the
mind became more elastic.&nbsp; Straight from the reddening west
blew the wild whirling wind, which, like some old giant,
frolicsome yet kind, spread out its open palms upon my back,
fairly shoving me along.&nbsp; This was living&mdash;this fine
exaltation, this surging up of joyous emotions; and from a
gnarled ash tree a storm-thrush with throbbing speckled throat
told the same tale of a heart set free from every care.&nbsp;
Such was my mood when at a turn of the road a red-shawled figure,
surely a Gypsy, appeared for a moment and as suddenly was lost to
sight down a gloomy yew-fringed drive leading to the rear of a
low grey mansion.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll be out again presently,
thought I; so I resolved to await the woman&rsquo;s
reappearance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, like a spreading forest fire, the sunset flung its
flaming crimson far over the land.&nbsp; Tree boughs and boles
caught the glow, and underfoot the very grasses burnt by winter
frosts seemed dyed with blood.&nbsp; Across a riot of sundown
colours, black rooks were heading for their resting-place in the
upland woods rugged against a castle-phantasy of lurid cloud
piled up in the east.</p>
<p>Loitering there, methought of the wandering Gypsies who in
other days had passed along this desolate road.&nbsp; I seemed
again to behold a gang of slouching Herons, swarthy, black-eyed,
secretive, accompanied by their pack-ponies and donkeys carrying
tent-rods, pots, and pans.&nbsp; Who shall say what <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>processions
of old Romany souls, long departed, here visit the glimpses of
the moon?</p>
<p>The moments flew by, but no Gypsy came.&nbsp; A little longer
I waited, pacing sharply up and down the roadway, then as the red
shawl had not put in an appearance, visions of a cosy meal by the
fire of a certain inn began to beckon alluringly, so I started on
my way again.&nbsp; Soon I forgot all about the Gypsy, who by
this time had probably done a good stroke in the <i>duker</i>in
line among the servants of the mansion.&nbsp; However, a rutted,
grassy lane turning off to the left drew one&rsquo;s eye towards
a gorsy corner where the chimney of a Gypsy van flung a drooping
trail of smoke over the tangles, and, going forward, I shouted in
the doorway, &ldquo;Anybody at home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man&rsquo;s scared face looked out.&nbsp; Perhaps he had
expected a command to quit his corner and draw out into the windy
night.&nbsp; A moment later in a tone of relief, he
said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I know who you are.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be the
<i>rashai</i> I met wi&rsquo; Jonathan Boswell by the
watermill.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember I moved away when you
began to <i>roker</i> (talk)?&nbsp; My pal Boswell wanted to have
you to himself.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I took my hook.&nbsp; But
come inside a bit.&nbsp; This wind&rsquo;s enough to blow your
wery <i>bal avr&icirc;</i>&rdquo; (hair off).</p>
<p>How strange it is that if a Gypsy has seen you anywhere for a
few moments, he is able to identify your very shadow for ever
after.</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>Gladly I joined Old Frank in his cheery
<i>v&acirc;do</i>, which certainly suggested comfort and gaiety
to this traveller on the wild March evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave me a bit of a shock,&rdquo; said Frank.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At first I took you for a <i>muskro</i> (constable), but
as soon as the light of my lamp fell on your face I reckernized
you in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We talked awhile of Old Jonathan, whose faithful consort Fazzy
had passed away up in Yorkshire.&nbsp; This brought to mind the
red-shawled woman whom I had seen down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be my <i>monushni</i> (wife).&nbsp; I
expect her home di-rectly.&nbsp; When she comes, you pretend to
be a <i>muskro</i>&rdquo;&mdash;this with a broad grin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Say roughish-like, &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t your name Liddy
West afore you was married?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then draw out a bit of
paper, a letter folded long or anythink like that&rsquo;ll do,
and say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve come to take you for
fortune-telling.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one understands the whole art and mystery of practical
joking better than the Gypsy, and he dearly loves to play pranks
even upon his fellows.&nbsp; It is part and parcel of the
Gypsy&rsquo;s innate spirit of mischief, examples of which I have
seen not a few in my time.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Having acquiesced in the joke, our talk presently ran on
<i>muskro</i>s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Muskro</i>s <i>s&icirc; jukel</i>s&rdquo; (policemen
are dogs), said the Gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a pal of mine who was up to card <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>games
[sharping?], and at Doncaster Races he happened to drop a word or
two in <i>Romanes</i> (Gypsy tongue) to a mate.&nbsp; A
<i>muskro</i> was standing near, and bless me if he didn&rsquo;t
<i>jin</i> the <i>tshib</i> (know the language), and of course my
pal and his mate was <i>lel</i>&rsquo;d <i>opr&ecirc;</i> (taken
up).&nbsp; &rsquo;Pend upon it, <i>muskro</i>s is
<i>jukel</i>s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A good step farther along the road stood the tavern, the
&ldquo;Black Boy,&rdquo; whose swinging sign of an Ethiopian
countenance I was eager to see, since I was to spend the night
there in order to resume my fossil-hunting on the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see me a little later at the <i>kitshima</i>
(inn) down the road, and mind you bring the missis and your
fiddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I rose to go, I noticed Frank gave a
sidelong glance at my bulging knapsack, and in order to satisfy
his curiosity, I took out a fossil, a fine <i>gryphea
incurva</i>, on seeing which he drew back, holding up his hands
in real or mock horror, I could scarcely say which.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>D&acirc;bla</i>, that be one of the Devil&rsquo;s
toe-nails, wery onlucky stuff to carry about you!&nbsp; Wherever
did you get it from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off the <i>Beng</i>&rsquo;s <i>p&icirc;ro</i>
(Devil&rsquo;s foot), to be sure,&rdquo; I said, with a laugh,
and renewed my invitation pressingly.&nbsp; He promised to
come.</p>
<p>What a relief to stretch your limbs before a glowing fire
inside an old-fashioned inn, when boisterous winds are shaking
the window-panes and driving the loose straw from the cobbled
yard into the hedge bottoms.&nbsp; No stranger at this house on
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>the
ridgeway, I know every nook of the room.&nbsp; There is the old
gun still reared up in yonder corner.&nbsp; From nails in the
cross-beams hang flitches of bacon and bulky hams.&nbsp; Plates
and dishes arranged on racks glitter in the firelight.&nbsp; The
pewter mugs on the dresser and the bright copper warming-pan
hanging on the wall reflect the glow of the ruddy flames darting
up the wide chimney.&nbsp; Here and there hang modern oleographs
whose crude tints have been softened by smoke.</p>
<p>Tea is set on a table over which a lamp hanging from a hook in
the ceiling casts a pleasant radiance.&nbsp; During my meal the
landlord, ruddy of countenance, looks in and greets me in a
friendly way.&nbsp; From his talk with his wife, a slight,
frail-looking woman of seventy who sits darning by the fire, I
gather that a horse is very ill in the stable, and any moment the
veterinary surgeon is expected.&nbsp; Presently, the barking of a
dog in the front of the inn announces his arrival in a gig, and
the landlord hurries out with a storm-lantern in his hand.&nbsp;
In a few minutes, the two men enter, and before the fire the
burly vet rubs his hands, talks in clear, sharp tones, then,
tossing off a &ldquo;scotch&rdquo; smoking hot, he wishes us
good-night.&nbsp; Whereupon the innkeeper goes off to the
stable.</p>
<p>Tea over, a small maid with chestnut hair and spotless
pinafore clears the table, and I move to the high-backed settle
opposite the landlady.&nbsp; In the fire-grate a huge chunk of
wood burns brightly, <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>and every now and then a puff of
wood-smoke comes out into the room.</p>
<p>Addressing the old lady, I inform her that I am expecting some
visitors to see me to-night, and they are stopping in a little
lane down the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we had those Gypsies up here this morning.&nbsp;
Their faces are well known round here, though we don&rsquo;t have
them so much as we used to do.&nbsp; You take an interest in
Gypsies, don&rsquo;t you, sir?&nbsp; At least I&rsquo;ve heard it
said that you do.&nbsp; They don&rsquo;t often set foot inside
your church, I should think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they do, and their reverent behaviour would
certainly put to shame some of the more regular attenders.&nbsp;
If their unfamiliarity with print leads them to hold a borrowed
book upside down, they do at anyrate kneel upon their knees
instead of squatting upon the benches, and I have never once
known them to go to sleep during sermon-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking about Gypsies and churches, I am reminded of a funny
experience I once had all through a Gypsy cabman&rsquo;s
mistake.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I had promised to take an afternoon service at a village
church miles away in the country, and the road to it was
unfamiliar to me.&nbsp; On my naming the place, the driver said
that he knew every inch of the road, and, trusting myself in his
hands, we bowled along for several miles, and at <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>last struck
off into a tangle of green lanes.&nbsp; A few minutes before the
hour of service&mdash;three o&rsquo;clock&mdash;my driver put me
down at an old grey stone church, saying, &ldquo;Here we are,
sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Entering the church, I found a congregation
assembled, and, going into the belfry, I asked for the vestry
wherein to robe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t got one here.&nbsp; Our pass&rsquo;n
dresses hisself in his house and comes in at that little
door.&rdquo;&nbsp; The sexton then conducted me to a
chantry-chapel full of dusty figures of knights and their ladies
lying side by side with their feet resting upon their
hounds.&nbsp; There I robed and awaited the ceasing of the
bells.&nbsp; When they stopped, I stepped towards the prayer
desk, when, to my astonishment, there appeared through the small
door in the chancel a fully-robed parson, white-headed and bowed
with age.&nbsp; We met and exchanged astonished glances.</p>
<p>Said I, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid there is some
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deaf, and
can&rsquo;t hear a word you say.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then went to his
desk, and knelt before commencing evensong.</p>
<p>It was an uncomfortable five minutes for me.&nbsp; I could
hear the congregation tittering and the mixed choir
giggling.&nbsp; In despair I went to the lady organist, and asked
for the name of the church.&nbsp; Her reply made it clear that I
had come to the wrong village, and, rushing out by the chancel
door, I sought my cabby, whom I rated soundly for his
blunder.&nbsp; Fortunately <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>my destination was no more than a
mile and a half farther on.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In a little while, the tavern door opened noisily, admitting a
rush of wind.&nbsp; There was a sound of naily boots on the
threshold, and Gypsy Frank and his wife entered.&nbsp; In a few
moments they were happy enough on the black settle with mugs of
good Newark brew in front of them.</p>
<p>Just before the Gypsies had arrived, I had been studying a
pocket-map of the locality, and once again I had an old
impression confirmed that many out-of-the-way country districts
are dotted over with place-names bearing witness to the
prevalence of Gypsy encampments in the past.&nbsp; I mean such
names as &ldquo;Gypsy Lane,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gypsy Nook,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gypsy Dale,&rdquo; and the like.&nbsp; On the map I had
noted a &ldquo;Gypsy Corner,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gypsy Bridge,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Gypsy Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about &ldquo;Gypsy Ford&rdquo; that I put a question to
Old Frank sitting by my side, and he described the shallow
crossing at a bend in the river over which before now I had
passed by a narrow plank-bridge.&nbsp; According to my Gypsy, one
night many years ago a quarrel arose in the Romany tents encamped
near the ford, and in the course of a fight between two kinsmen,
one of them was slain.&nbsp; Speedily a grave was dug, and, the
corpse having been covered up, the Gypsies fled the spot.&nbsp;
This affair became widely known, and little wonder that a legend
arose about a &ldquo;something&rdquo; having been seen in the
neighbourhood of the ford.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;s mebbe heard,&rdquo; said Frank,
&ldquo;about Gypsy Jack&rsquo;s wife, &lsquo;Flash&rsquo;
Rosabel, who was drownded at the ford on just such a wild night
as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let&rsquo;s camp in the lane on this side of the
water,&rsquo; says Jack&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Keka</i>&rsquo; (No), says he, &lsquo;not in
this <i>drom</i> (road) where the <i>mulo</i> (ghost)
walks.&nbsp; With a bright moon like this, our <i>grai</i>
(horse) will see to pull us through the river all right, never
fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, he whipped up the horse and steered straight
into the ford.&nbsp; And then a sad thing happened.&nbsp; There
had been a deal o&rsquo; rain and the stream was bigger and
stronger than Jack had any idea of.&nbsp; Somewheres about the
middle of the river, the hoss was swept off its feet, the wagon
tumbled over on to its side, and poor old &lsquo;Flash&rsquo;
Rosabel was carried away and drownded.&nbsp; Jack allus said that
the <i>grai</i> must have <i>dik</i>&rsquo;d the
<i>mulo</i>&rdquo; (the horse must have seen the ghost).&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a tale what&rsquo;s been told by many a
traveller&rsquo;s fire.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Just then the publican came in, panting after a tussle with
the wind, and, being on good terms with my Gypsy friends, he
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you&rsquo;ve brought your
music.&nbsp; Gi&rsquo; us a tune, Frank.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then the
Gypsy, taking his fiddle from its baize bag, screwed up the
strings, and, having tuned them to his liking, gave us a merry
air from memory&rsquo;s repertoire.&nbsp; At the back of the
clear cantabile of the air, you heard the deep roar of the
storm.&nbsp; Once I <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>went to the window and looked out
into the night.&nbsp; Athwart the white moonlit road lay the
sharp black shadows of the ash trees rising from the far
hedgerow, and, as I watched the swaying, writhing boughs, a
lonely horseman sped past, a phantom he seemed more than a living
being, and, returning to my nook in the ingle, I heard in fancy
all through the Gypsy&rsquo;s music the haunting clatter of the
night-rider&rsquo;s horse, and wondered what mysterious mission
had called him forth on this riotous March evening.&nbsp; Now the
fiddler ceased, and his pewter was forthwith replenished.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good ale, this,&rdquo; says Frank, wiping his mouth with
the back of his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; put in the
landlady, looking over her spectacles, and glad, if the truth be
known, to give her darning a rest; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Newark ale,
and no better drink could any man wish for; we&rsquo;ve sold
nothing else for years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the landlord, who by this time had recovered his
breath&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a strange case as I see&rsquo;d in the paper
t&rsquo;other day about the wise woman getting
&lsquo;trapped&rsquo; by the constable&rsquo;s wife as went to
have her fortune told.&nbsp; The paper said as how a crystal ball
were used, but I&rsquo;m blest if I knows how anybody can expect
to see their future in a thing o&rsquo; that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno so much about that,&rdquo; remarked Old Liddy,
who had been dreaming over the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;A woman as had
a crystal once told my dad he would go to <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>prison in a
fortnight, and sure enough he did, along wi&rsquo; a conjurer
who&rsquo;d been up to his tricks, and dad says to him when they
was in jail, &lsquo;A mighty poor conjurer you be, my fine
fellow, if you can&rsquo;t conjure us out of this
place.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believes there <i>is</i> summut in
crystals.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And then I was tempted to tell how a clairvoyant&rsquo;s
crystal once did me a good turn.&nbsp; Let me explain that many
years ago, when I was a curate on the Wolds, our Rector&rsquo;s
aged wife used to bring me rare wild-flowers to be named, and
thus I won a place in the lady&rsquo;s good books.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the Rector&rsquo;s wife died.&nbsp; Not long
after, I moved away to another sphere of work.&nbsp; Then came
the news of the decease of the old Rector himself.&nbsp; One
morning, twenty years after quitting that Wold parish, a letter
reached me, asking if I had been a curate with Canon A&mdash; in
such and such years, and further inquiring whether my wife
Elizabeth was still alive.&nbsp; Of course I had no difficulty in
satisfying the writer of the letter, and his speedy reply brought
an agreeable enclosure in the form of a cheque, a little legacy
bequeathed to us by a codicil to the will of the old
Rector&rsquo;s wife who loved wild-flowers.&nbsp; But the
strangest part of the story is yet to come.&nbsp; During a visit
to London, the wife of the present parson of our old parish
visited a clairvoyant who by the aid of a crystal declared that
in the drawing-room of her home stood a small brass <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>handled
writing-table containing several drawers, in one of which would
be found on examination a bundle of papers long neglected.&nbsp;
On returning home, the writing-table was duly searched, with the
result that the forgotten codicil was disclosed, and in it were
mentioned some legacies bequeathed to friends, several of whom
had since passed away, but my wife and I happened to be among the
survivors.&nbsp; Thus there came to us, as I have said, an
agreeable arrival by the morning post, so that if &ldquo;seeing
is believing,&rdquo; my wife and I ought nevermore to scoff at
clairvoyants and their crystals.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dawdi</i>!&rdquo; (expression of surprise) exclaimed
Liddy, with something of a gasp in her voice, while Old Frank
looked wonder struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that licks all I&rsquo;ve ever heard,&rdquo; said
the publican, slapping his knee in punctuation of his
surprise.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s have another tune,
Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the fiddler broke into a Scottish air with
variations, his body swaying to and fro the while.&nbsp; During
several staves, the player laid his cheek on the violin in a
fashion so comical that at the end of the tune I could not
refrain from remarking&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You reminded me just now, my pal, of Wry-necked Charley
the <i>boshomengro</i>&rdquo; (fiddler).&nbsp; With a
good-natured grin he replied&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know that tale about the fiddler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here it is, in my own words.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>Charley Lovell, a fiddler of renown, was returning one
evening after a tiring day&rsquo;s fiddling at a village
feast.&nbsp; On the way to his tent, which was pitched in a
disused quarry, the Gypsy took from his pocket a few coins he had
received by way of payment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor luck, I call it, to
be paid like this for such hard work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
commiserating himself, he trudged along the sunken lane leading
to his tent.&nbsp; Imagine his surprise to find at the tent door
a tall gentleman dressed in black broad-cloth.&nbsp; Dark of
complexion, black-eyed, and polished in demeanour, the stranger
turned to meet the Gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo; said Charley, bowing low, for
he had the sense to perceive that a gentleman stood before
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great kindness,&rdquo; responded the stranger,
&ldquo;for I have heard of your skilful playing upon this
wonderful instrument&rdquo; (tapping Charley&rsquo;s fiddle with
his finger), &ldquo;and I wish to know if you will come to play
at a dance of mine to-morrow night.&rdquo;&nbsp; The place and
hour were named, and the Gypsy promised to be there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your hands, my man;&rdquo; and into them the
stranger emptied a pocketful of silver coins, and departed,
smiling over his shoulder at the perplexed Gypsy.&nbsp; All that
night Charley tossed restlessly on his bed of straw.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A fore-handed payment, and generous too.&nbsp; Who can
that dark gentleman be?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the morning the Gypsy
betook himself to a neighbouring priest, who, on hearing his
story, looked grave.</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>&ldquo;You have made a bargain with the
Devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me how I can get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must keep your engagement, for, if you don&rsquo;t,
the Devil will fetch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do when I get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do as I say, all will be well.&nbsp; When you
are asked to strike up, you must be sure to play nothing but
slow, solemn psalm tunes.&nbsp; Mind you do as I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the appointed hour the trembling fiddler stood on the
moonlit sward within the walls of a ruined castle.&nbsp; Awaiting
his arrival was the tall dark gentleman surrounded by his guests,
an array of lords and ladies in silks and satins.&nbsp; When the
signal was given for the fiddler to commence his music, Charley
drew his bow over the strings, evoking none but psalm tunes,
solemn and slow, as the priest had advised.&nbsp; After a few
moments of this sort of music, the Devil marched up to the Gypsy,
and, fixing his large black eyes upon him, said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us something more lively at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; said the Gypsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, take <i>that</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;and the Devil
struck Charley a smart blow on the cheek, twisting the poor
fellow&rsquo;s head on one side, and so it ever remained.&nbsp;
After that, he was always known as &ldquo;Wry-necked&rdquo;
Charley.</p>
<p>As the clock was striking the hour of ten, the rural
tavern&rsquo;s closing-time, my Gypsy friends stepped out into
the night.</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>All
through the long hours the wind howled in the chimney and rattled
the casements, and one traveller at least slept but fitfully in
his four-poster draped with curtains of red damask.</p>
<p>In the morning the landlord informed me at breakfast that a
tree had been blown down across the road, and, while
&ldquo;rembling&rdquo; under his overturned straw-stack, a fine
fox was found smothered, and, &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I shall always think of last night whenever I look at
this,&rdquo; holding up a beautiful tawny brush.</p>
<p>The storm-rack was still scudding overhead as I bade adieu to
the quaint pair on the footworn doorstep of the &ldquo;Black
Boy&rdquo; on the ridge way.</p>

229</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HORNCASTLE FAIR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> Lincoln, York, and Chester,
the town of Horncastle originated within the boundaries of a
Roman <i>castrum</i>, and to this day an old-world atmosphere
clings to its narrow, cobbled streets.</p>
<p>Readers who know their Borrow will recall the visit of
&ldquo;The Romany Rye&rdquo; to Horncastle in the August of 1825,
in order to sell a horse which he had purchased by means of a
loan from his Gypsy friend Jasper.</p>
<p>Nowhere perhaps are the changes wrought by the passing years
more plainly seen than at a horse-fair of ancient standing.&nbsp;
Horncastle has inhabitants who remember when the great August
Horse-Fair occupied fully a fortnight or three weeks, and was
widely recognized as an event of the first rank.&nbsp; Within my
own observation, this fair, like others of its kind, has declined
with swift strides.&nbsp; In my time, buyers would be present
from all parts of the country, as well as from the Continent, and
members of our best Gypsy families invariably made a point of
attending.&nbsp; In all these respects, however, the once famous
fair has dwindled in a very marked manner.</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Let
me describe a twentieth-century visit to the August
horse-mart.</p>
<p>Having approached the town along a bold ridgeway commanding a
countryside yellowing to harvest, I arrive to find the place
astir with dealers and horses.&nbsp; Though now but a one-day
affair, the mart is not without its pleasing aspects to a lover
of such scenes.&nbsp; The chief centre of business is known as
the Bull Ring, where well-clad dealers from our English towns,
horsey-looking men slapping their thighs with malacca canes, rub
shoulders with rubicund farmers from Wold and Marsh, grooms and
Gypsies.&nbsp; Not for the purpose of buying or selling horses
have I come hither, but for no other reason than to meet the
Gypsy families who usually turn up at the fair.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Behind the Parish Church of St. Mary, in a pasture pleasantly
open to the sun, numerous caravans are drawn up under the
hedges.&nbsp; It is here that the better sort of Gypsies
congregate.&nbsp; Down Hemingby Lane lies an encampment of poorer
travellers, and some of the same sort of people have drawn into
the yard of the &ldquo;New Inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the course of the
day I shall visit these three companies of Gypsies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, passing over the Bain Bridge, I step inside the old
Parish Church and, taking out from my pocket a well-thumbed copy
of <i>The Romany Rye</i>, I turn to the passage where Borrow
talks with the sexton about the rusty scythes hanging on the
wall.&nbsp; Just then a lady, evidently an American tourist, who
has been looking <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>up Tennyson&rsquo;s footprints, which abound
hereabouts, asks:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me anything about those strange-looking
things on the wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various theories have been advanced to account for the
presence of these old scythe-blades within the sacred building,
the popular opinion being that they were used as instruments of
war at Winceby Fight on 11th October 1643.&nbsp; So much, indeed,
Borrow seems to have gathered from the sexton, but the
better-informed authorities of to-day think that they are relics
of the rising known as the Pilgrimage of Grace in the year
1536.</p>
<p>Quitting the fine old church, I passed out into the fair, and
straightway met a Gypsy fingering a telegram.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will
you read it for me, please?&rdquo;&nbsp; The message was from a
popular Baroness who was desirous of borrowing a caravan for a
bazaar; and as I pencilled a reply on the back of the telegram,
the Gypsy declared that he would sleep in a tent till his
&ldquo;house on wheels&rdquo; returned to him.</p>
<p>I have always known that Gypsies readily help one another when
in trouble.&nbsp; This man, before going off with his telegram,
told me a pleasing thing.&nbsp; It appears that an aged Gypsy,
whose horse had died suddenly, had no money to buy another with,
but a pal of his, going round with a cap among the Gypsy dealers
at the fair, had quickly taken ten pounds, which were handed up
to the old man who was now able to buy himself an animal.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>In
<i>The Romany Rye</i>, Borrow speaks of the inn where he put up
as having a yard which opened into the principal street of the
town.&nbsp; On entering that yard he was greeted by the ostlers
with&mdash;&ldquo;It is no use coming here&mdash;all
full&mdash;no room whatever;&rdquo; whilst one added in an
undertone, &ldquo;That &rsquo;ere a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t a bad-looking
horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a large upstairs room overlooking a court,
the newcomer dined with several people connected with the
fair.</p>

</a></p>
<p>During former visits to Horncastle I had tried to identify
Borrow&rsquo;s inn, but without result.&nbsp; Happily, on the
present occasion, I came upon a local antiquary from whom I
gathered that Borrow&rsquo;s inn was undoubtedly the
&ldquo;George,&rdquo; now converted into a post office.&nbsp;
Strolling down the quondam inn-yard, my friend pointed out the
bow-window through which the jockey so neatly pitched his bottle
of pink champagne.&nbsp; Also, he told a good tale of the fair in
its palmy days&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Public-houses, though very numerous in the town, were yet
unable to supply the fair folk with all the drink they required,
and any householder could take out what was called a Bough
Licence on payment of seven shillings and sixpence.&nbsp; Having
decided to take out such a licence, a man and his wife obtained a
barrel of beer and displayed the customary green bough over their
door.&nbsp; On the eve of the fair the husband said to his
wife&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if this beer is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t without paying for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, my dear, I&rsquo;ll have
three-pen&rsquo;orth,&rdquo; handing over the coins to his
wife.</p>
<p>He appeared to enjoy it so much that she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have three-pen&rsquo;orth,&rdquo; handing the
pence to her husband.&nbsp; Then he had another drink, passing
the threepence back again.&nbsp; And the same coppers passed to
and fro until the barrel was empty.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was to Horncastle Fair, years ago, that Jem Mace came with
his master, Nat Langham, to whom he had been introduced at
Lincoln Fair, where Nat had a sparring troupe which he had
brought down from the metropolis.&nbsp; At Horncastle, Jem had a
tremendous glove-fight with the local champion, who was the
terror of the district.&nbsp; This fellow was bigger and older
than Mace, who was then only in his eighteenth year, and for a
long time the issue was doubtful, but at last the Horncastle
champion was licked to a standstill, and had to give in.</p>
<p>Walking down a crooked by-lane, past a shop where a chatty
little tailor sat repairing a scarlet hunting-coat (the South
Wolds Kennels lie a few miles outside the town), I found a camp
of Gypsies in a field, and near one of the fires on the grass sat
Liddy Brown, a crone of seventy years, puffing a black pipe, her
curls peeping from beneath a gay <i>diklo</i> (kerchief).&nbsp;
In the course of our talk, she spoke <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>of our hilly country, and recalled
the days when her folk had pack-donkeys and camped in the green
lanes on the Wolds.&nbsp; A grand-daughter of Fowk Heron, she had
some diverting reminiscences of her mother Mizereti, and her
aunts Cinderella and Tiena.&nbsp; The last-named was bitten by a
mad dog, and thereby came to an untimely end.</p>
<p>Returning to the town, I looked into the &ldquo;New Inn&rdquo;
yard and found a number of Gypsies stopping there.&nbsp; The
women and girls had donned their smartest fair-going
raiment.&nbsp; As I viewed these wanderers, it was not easy to
realize that they were the lingering remnants of the once
powerful tribes of Browns and Winters hailing from the Border
country in the days of Sheriff Walter Scott.</p>
<p>Passing through the archway of the inn, I mingle again with
the crowd, but no thimblengro, no Irish Murtagh, no Jack Dale
meet the eye, though, curiously enough, from the racing stables
at Baumber, where the Derby winner of 1875&mdash;Prince
Batthyany&rsquo;s Galopin&mdash;was born, there are two or three
jockeys looking more than usually diminutive among the burly
dealers in the street.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the afternoon the fair began to
slacken.&nbsp; The few remaining groups of horses seemed to have
gone to sleep in the sultry Bull Ring.&nbsp; Already farmers were
moving off in their light traps, and dealers were making for the
railway station.&nbsp; Going along the riverside path I saw a
Gypsy man asleep at the foot of a tree, and, climbing <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>a fence, I
found myself in the encampment behind the church.&nbsp; The scene
was enlivening.&nbsp; Seated around their fires most of the
Gypsies were making ready for the evening meal.&nbsp; Near a
little tent the aged Mrs. Petulengro, a veritable &ldquo;Mother
in Egypt,&rdquo; was lighting her pipe.&nbsp; Her grand-daughter
coming out of the tent offers her a stool to sit upon, but the
old lady scorns the idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should tumble off a
thing like that.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m better down here,&rdquo;
pointing to a sack spread by the fire beside which two kettles
are hissing.</p>
<p>In various parts of the field the Petulengros are gathered
together.&nbsp; Here are tall Alfy and Hook-nosed Suki,
&ldquo;Rabbitskin&rdquo; Bob, and &ldquo;Ratcatcher&rdquo;
Charley.&nbsp; During supper, I had to listen to a disquisition
on lying from Suki.&nbsp; Put into a nutshell, her ideas amount
to this: Lying is of two kinds.&nbsp; There is lying for a
living, else how could any sort of business be carried on.&nbsp;
But business deceptions are not to be mentioned in the same
breath with nasty lies which are meant to &ldquo;hurt a
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember, <i>rashai</i>, that time we met you by
Newark, when Elijah was with us?&nbsp; A jolly old fellow he
were.&nbsp; He often got into <i>staruben</i> (prison) for
fighting but never for stealing.&nbsp; He would go through an
orchard, like that one there&rdquo; (pointing to some apple-trees
close by), &ldquo;but do you think he&rsquo;d ever pick up an
apple?&nbsp; Not he, he&rsquo;d never steal nothink,
wouldn&rsquo;t Elijah.&nbsp; He could stand hard knocks, and
would only fight a better man than hisself.&nbsp; He was <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>that tough,
nothing ever hurt him.&nbsp; He would lay asleep under a wagon
with never a shirt on him and take no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elijah was one of three brothers&mdash;tall, powerful
fellows.&nbsp; Sometimes the trio, Elijah, Master, and Swallow,
would enter a lonely tavern, and having ordered ale would depart
without paying for it.&nbsp; When the publican protested, the
Gypsies displayed their brawny arms and huge fists before his
face.&nbsp; One day they had performed this favourite trick
several times, and were paying an evening call at a village inn,
where they sat a long time.&nbsp; Waxing quarrelsome, the
brothers first brawled among themselves, and afterwards got at
cross-purposes with a farmer in the tap-room.&nbsp; In the course
of a tussle with this person, Swallow fell upon him as he lay on
the floor, and, as they struggled there, a steel rush-threading
needle of large size, used in mending chair bottoms, dropped from
the Gypsy&rsquo;s pocket.&nbsp; Seizing this, Elijah pricked the
farmer in the ribs, and then flung the needle at the feet of
Swallow, who picked it up.&nbsp; The farmer&rsquo;s cries
attracted the attention of a village constable who was going
by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, what&rsquo;s the matter here?&rdquo; said the
constable, stepping into the tap-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These Gypsies are trying to murder me,&rdquo; said the
farmer.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s stuck me with a
long knife as he&rsquo;s got about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pockets of the Gypsies were searched, and <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>the steel
needle was found upon Swallow.&nbsp; As the constable held it up
between his fingers, the farmer cried&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he tried to kill me with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three brothers were arrested and underwent their trial,
with the result that Elijah and Master were sent to prison for a
year, but poor Swallow, although innocent of the charge made
against him, was transported for fourteen years.</p>
<p>By that Gypsy fire the evening meal passed pleasantly enough,
and when at a later hour I returned to the town, the darkened
houses were framing the cobbled street, and through the open
window of a tavern I caught a soft Romany phrase along with the
clinking of glasses.&nbsp; And then from under the archway of the
inn yard a dwarfish Gypsy, mounted on a lean horse, rode off with
a great clatter into the dusk.</p>

LORE&mdash;THE PASSING OF JONATHAN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Tetford churchyard, not far from
my Rectory on the Lincolnshire Wolds, lies the grave of two
celebrated Gypsies, Tyso Boswell and Edward, or &ldquo;No
Name,&rdquo; Hearn (Heron), who were killed by lightning on 5th
August 1831.&nbsp; The incident seems to have made a profound
impression upon our Gypsies, and to this day it is everywhere
remembered among the Anglo-Romany clans.&nbsp; A large company of
the Boswells and Hearns (Herons) appear to have halted at Tetford
on their way to Horncastle August Fair, at that time a horse-mart
of great importance.&nbsp; Overtaken by a thunderstorm, Tyso and
No Name were sheltering in a barn, whither they had gone for some
straw, when a stroke of lightning descended fatally upon
them.</p>
<p>An aged Gypsy, Lucy Brown (born in the year 1807), once
informed me that she remembered the incident quite clearly.&nbsp;
Said she, &ldquo;We were camping atop of Tetford Hill, just above
Ruckland Valley, when the lightning struck the poor
fellows.&nbsp; We <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>were on our way to Horncastle Fair.&nbsp; I mind it
all, <i>rashai</i>, as if it had happened only
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Westarus Boswell&rsquo;s autobiography, recorded (in his
own words) by Smart and Crofton in their work <i>The Dialect of
the English Gypsies</i>, are some references to this
event&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I was born at Dover.&nbsp; My father (Tyso)
was a soldier, and I was born in the army.&nbsp; My father, when
I was born, was in charge of the great gun (Queen Anne&rsquo;s
pocket-piece).&nbsp; After a while he came home, and left the
army.&nbsp; He came down into Yorkshire, and there he stayed for
many years, and all our family were brought up in that county,
and there we all stayed after he was killed in
Lincolnshire.&nbsp; He died when I was a lad.&nbsp; The lightning
struck him and another, both together.&nbsp; They were
cousins.&nbsp; Our people put them both in one grave.&nbsp; There
I left them, poor fellows.&nbsp; I was much grieved at it.&nbsp;
He (Tyso) always dressed well.&nbsp; When he was buried, I took a
wife, and went all over the country. . . .&nbsp; His
cousin&rsquo;s name was called No Name, because he was not
christened till he was an old man, and then they called him
Edward.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A curious story attaches to &ldquo;No Name&rdquo; Hearn.&nbsp;
His parents took him to church to be christened, and when the
parson said, &ldquo;Name this child,&rdquo; the Gypsy mother
answered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jehovah, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I
cannot give your child that name,&rdquo; protested the
clergyman.&nbsp; Whereupon the Gypsies stalked out of <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>the church
muttering, &ldquo;He shall be called &lsquo;No
Name,&rsquo;&rdquo; and by this fore-name he was known all
through his life, although in his old age, as Westarus Boswell
has told us, he was baptized in the name of Edward.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the funeral of Tyso and Edward was
attended by many Gypsies from far and near, and for some years
afterwards the grave was visited annually by relatives, who are
said to have poured libations of ale upon it.&nbsp; A grandson of
Tyso relates that he once found a hole &ldquo;as big as a fire
bucket&rdquo; in the side of the grave.&nbsp; This he stuffed
with hay, and to my own knowledge the hole is still there, the
brickwork of the vault having fallen inward.&nbsp; Aged folk at
Tetford tell how a witch formerly lived in a cottage near the
churchyard.&nbsp; One of her cats kittened down the hole in the
vault, and passers-by would shudder to see the kittens bolt like
rabbits into the Gypsies&rsquo; grave.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>If the Gypsies possess any religion at all, it may be summed
up in one sentence&mdash;reverence for the dead.&nbsp; In bygone
ages the Gypsies buried their dead in wild lonely spots, and
though for many years the wanderers have been granted Christian
burial, yet now and then an aged <i>Romanitshel</i> on his
deathbed will express a desire to be laid to rest in the open and
not in the churchyard.&nbsp; Moses Boswell, a Derbyshire Gypsy,
requested that he might be buried &ldquo;under the
fireplace,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> on the site of an encampment <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>of his
people.&nbsp; When dying, Isaac Heron said, &ldquo;Bury me under
a hedge,&rdquo; a reminiscence of the earlier mode of
sepulture.&nbsp; In his <i>Lavengro</i>, Borrow describes the
burial of old Mrs. Herne: &ldquo;The body was placed not in a
coffin but on a bier, and carried not to the churchyard but to a
deep dingle close by; and there it was buried beneath a rock,
dressed just as I have told (in a red cloak and big bonnet of
black beaver); and this was done at the bidding of Leonora, who
had heard her <i>bebee</i> (aunt) say that she wished to be
buried, not in gorgeous fashion, but like a Roman woman of the
old blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the information of some East-Anglian Gypsies, my friend,
Mr. T. W. Thompson, a good tsiganologue, writes: &ldquo;It must
have been somewhere about 1830 when Borrow&rsquo;s friend,
Ambrose Smith (Jasper Petulengro), found one of the Hernes
burying his wife in a ditch near Gorleston, took the body away
and gave it a Christian burial to prevent further trouble
befalling the old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an entertaining volume entitled, <i>Caravanning and Camping
Out</i>, Mr. J. Harris Stone describes a wayside Gypsy
burial&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some twenty years ago a Gypsy died in an encampment
near Lulworth Cove in Dorset, and a friend of mine, who had
become great friends with the tribe because he used to go and
sing comic songs to them and perform simple conjuring tricks, was
asked to the funeral.&nbsp; He told me that the coffin was black,
and the burial took place at the cross-roads&mdash;<a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>not exactly
in the centre of the roadway where the highways crossed, but on
the patch of roadside waste at the angle of one of the
roads.&nbsp; Water was sprinkled on the coffin and earth thrown
on, in the course of the ritual in Romany, but no parson was
present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the grass-grown sand-dunes of an East Lincolnshire parish
is a camping-place frequented by Gypsies for many years
past.&nbsp; In turning up the soil thereabouts not long ago, some
labourers came upon a human skeleton, probably that of a Gypsy
who had been buried there.</p>
<p>I give these instances because it has been strongly asserted
that Christian burial only has been the Gypsies&rsquo; usage for
the last two hundred years.</p>
<p>Sometimes a careful watch is kept over the body between death
and burial.&nbsp; A Welsh correspondent who had an opportunity of
observing this practice, writes: &ldquo;I found my Romany friends
seated around a fire, and close by in a van lay the dead wife of
one of the company, awaiting burial on the morrow.&nbsp; Gypsies
about here do not go to bed from the time of a death till after
the funeral.&nbsp; They sit in company around the fire, and now
and again fall back and doze, but at least three must keep
awake.&nbsp; If only two were awake, one might drop off to sleep
and that would leave only one.&nbsp; Fear of the ghost is given
as the reason why they sit in company by the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a rule, the corpse is attired in the best clothes worn
during life.&nbsp; Sometimes the garments are turned <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>inside out,
a practice in Bulgarian mourning.&nbsp; When Zachariah Smith was
buried in Yorkshire four years ago the following articles were
enclosed in his coffin: a suit of clothes, besides the one he was
wearing, watch and chain, a muffler, four pocket handkerchiefs, a
hammer, a candle, and twopence.</p>
<p>On the day after the funeral, old-fashioned Gypsies destroy
the possessions of the dead, money excepted.&nbsp; All consumable
belongings are burnt, while the crockery, iron utensils, and
other articles are broken and dropped into a river, or buried, if
no water is near.&nbsp; Jewellery is often disposed of in a
similar manner.&nbsp; The horse of the deceased is either shot,
or sold to the knackers to be destroyed.&nbsp; Fear of the ghost
is the explanation of these ceremonies.&nbsp; So long as the
possessions of the dead person remain intact, the ghost is
believed to hover about them.&nbsp; In order, therefore, to
dispel the ghost of the dead, his belongings are destroyed.</p>
<p>Another observance, expressing in a striking manner the grief
of the bereaved, is seen in their abstention for many years, or
for ever, from the favourite food, beverage, or pastime of the
loved one whom they have lost.&nbsp; One day Richard Petulengro
called at my door and was offered refreshment in the
kitchen&mdash;&ldquo;Not any ale, thank you.&nbsp; My brother
died a bit ago, and he was wery fond of it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
touch it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is recorded of Old Isaac Joule that he would often spend
whole nights watching by his Gypsy wife&rsquo;s <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>tomb in
Yatton churchyard.&nbsp; Her headstone, which may still be seen,
bears the lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here lies Merily Joule<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A beauty bright:<br />
That left Isaac Joule<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart&rsquo;s delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1827.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes unusual articles are laid on graves.&nbsp; Upon his
boy&rsquo;s grave, Bohemia Boswell deposited a little teapot from
which the boy used to drink.&nbsp; Rodney Smith placed a
breast-pin upon his mother&rsquo;s grave in Norton
churchyard.</p>
<p>Gypsies shrink from uttering the names of the dead.&nbsp; Fear
of invoking the ghost underlies this ancient tabu.&nbsp; One of
the Herons had a child named Chasey, who died, and now he never
utters that name.&nbsp; He even invented a nickname for a friend
bearing the name of Chasey, in order to avoid pronouncing the
name of his own dead child.</p>
<p>One day, during conversation with Frampton Boswell, Groome
asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get your name, Frampton; was it your
father&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that, but wait a
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; And going to his mother&rsquo;s caravan, he
returned with a framed photograph of a gravestone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my poor father&rsquo;s name, but I&rsquo;ve
never spoken it since the day he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t want her to walk,&rdquo; said my old
friend, Frank Elliot, in explanation of a Gypsy&rsquo;s
reluctance <a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>to mention his dead sister&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; A Gypsy
boy was baptized Vyner Smith, but when his Uncle Vyner died, the
boy was renamed Robert, because the name Vyner was too painful a
reminder of the departed relation.</p>
<p>A death-omen among Gypsies is the cry of the
&ldquo;death-hawk&rdquo; heard over a camp by night.&nbsp; A
Gypsy once told me how two crows and two yellow pigeons flew to
and fro over him in a town street in the early morning.&nbsp; By
these signs he knew that his wife had died in the hospital, and
so it proved.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Let me close this chapter with the passing of my old friend
Jonathan Boswell.&nbsp; Not long ago tidings reached me that he
had died in his travelling cart, in which I have spent some happy
hours with him on the road.&nbsp; The last time I saw Jonathan
alive he was seated by his fire on a little lonely common, and
near him stood the old cart looking so very ramshackle that a
gust of wind might almost have wrecked it.&nbsp; Among the tufted
bog-rushes, the lambs were gambolling a few yards away.&nbsp; As
I sat with him, my old friend talked of bygone jaunts we had
taken together, and his grandson, who was present, recalled the
day he once spent at our Rectory.&nbsp; With slow and feeble
steps Jonathan walked with me to the edge of the common and waved
his cap in farewell.&nbsp; I never saw him again.&nbsp; I like to
think of the old man as, looking back, I saw him holding out his
hand <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>to
fondle a lamb whose confidence he had won while camping on the
common.</p>

<p>About a month after receiving the news of the death of my old
pal, I came upon his grandson, who told me that the
<i>v&acirc;do</i> (cart) had been <i>hotsherdo</i> (burnt).&nbsp;
The fragments which remained after the fire were duly buried, and
the faithful nag had been sent away to the hunt-kennels.&nbsp;
Thus, with the ancient ceremonies of his race, my old friend had
been laid to rest.</p>

<span class="GutSmall"><i>BITSHADO PAWDEL</i></span><span
class="GutSmall"> (TRANSPORTED)</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Thickly</span> sprinkled with Gypsy names
are the &ldquo;Transportation Lists&rdquo; (1787&ndash;1867)
reposing on the shelves of the Public Record Office in London;
yet as your eye scans those lists of names, how dull and ordinary
they look.&nbsp; It is not until you embark upon the arduous task
of tracking individuals in old newspaper files that you realize
the charm of unearthing buried romances in which the Gypsies
played a part.</p>
<p>If, on the one hand, the wildness and roughness of the times
are fully impressed upon your mind, there arises also the
unedifying spectacle of British justices vieing with one another
in their ardour for dispatching Gypsies across the sea on the
most trivial pretexts.&nbsp; In the Transportation Lists both
sexes are well represented, and occasionally one obtains the
<i>aliases</i> borne by Gypsies at the time of their
arrest.&nbsp; From a study of these <i>aliases</i>, it becomes
possible to trace the origin of some of our modern Gypsy
families, for it is quite in keeping with Romany usage for the
children of an expatriated father to adopt his <i>alias</i>.</p>
<p>I have never yet known an elderly Gypsy whose <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>memory
lacked a store of what may be called transportation tales, and,
listening to their recital, I have sometimes been saddened, if
not angered.&nbsp; What can we of the twentieth century think of
the &ldquo;justice&rdquo; (!) which sent a Romany mother across
the sea for stealing a lady&rsquo;s comb valued at sixpence, or
banished for seven years a middle-aged Gypsy man for the crime of
appropriating three penny picture-books from a cottage
doorway?</p>
<p>Over a few crimson embers on the ground I listened one summer
evening to tales from the lips of one of the old Herons, as we
sat together under a thorn hedge.&nbsp; For a theft of harness
Solli Heron (my informant&rsquo;s uncle) was sentenced to a
lengthy residence in an over-sea colony.&nbsp; The time came when
he and a few Gypsy comrades were led out of prison and placed in
chains on board the coach which was to convey them to the convict
ship.&nbsp; By some means Solli had become possessed of a small
file, wherewith, during the journey by coach, he managed to cut
through his irons and make his escape into a wood.&nbsp; After an
exciting chase through brake and brier, the Gypsy was recaptured
and duly shipped across the sea.</p>
<p>The following story shows that sometimes, when two Gypsies
were implicated in a crime, one of them would endeavour to screen
his companion.&nbsp; From the stables at Claremont House, Esher,
during the period of the Princess (afterwards Queen)
Victoria&rsquo;s residence, a horse and a mare were stolen <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>by two
Gypsies, an elderly man and a younger one.&nbsp; Early one foggy
morning these fellows broke open the stable door and took the
animals away.&nbsp; A hue-and-cry was set up, and, within a few
days of the theft, the red-breasted &ldquo;Runners&rdquo; had
made an arrest.&nbsp; In court, the Princess&rsquo;s coachman
declared that he had seen two men near the stable, but the elder
Gypsy persistently affirmed that he had done the business
entirely alone, and his endeavour to screen his mate proved
effectual.&nbsp; The young Gypsy was acquitted, but his companion
was transported for life to Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land.</p>
<p>The same spirit of self-sacrifice is seen in another
incident&mdash;</p>
<p>A Gypsy tinker and a sweep were arrested for stealing a pony
at a time when the penalty for horse-stealing was death.&nbsp;
Said the sweep to the tinker&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why need two of us be hanged for this job?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll swear that you know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the two were brought up for trial, the sweep, while
readily admitting his own guilt, asserted the tinker&rsquo;s
innocence with such vehemence that the judge and jury believed
his tale.&nbsp; The tinker got twelve months in jail, but the
sweep was hanged.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In his <i>Romany Word-Book</i>, Borrow mentions the
transportation of Fighting Jack Cooper, &ldquo;once the terror of
all the Light Weights of the English Ring, who knocked West
Country Dick to pieces, and <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>killed Paddy O&rsquo;Leary, the
fighting pot-boy, Jack Randall&rsquo;s pet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jack
Cooper and his brother Tom were transported under peculiar
circumstances.&nbsp; Tom was the first to be sent away.&nbsp; It
appears that the brothers went to a ball where, in the course of
the evening, Jack &ldquo;pinched&rdquo; a silver snuff-box, and
without meaning any harm dropped it into his brother&rsquo;s
pocket.&nbsp; Presently the snuff-box was missed by its owner,
and suspicion fell upon the Gypsies.&nbsp; A policeman was called
in, and, while conversing with Tom, offered him a pinch of
snuff.&nbsp; As the Gypsy removed a handkerchief from his pocket,
out flew the snuff-box to his great astonishment, for he was
unaware of the trick played by his brother.&nbsp; Speedily the
handcuffs were slipped upon Tom&rsquo;s wrists, and in due course
he was brought to trial.&nbsp; Before the judge, Jack swore that
Tom was innocent, as indeed he was, but he was nevertheless
sentenced to transportation.</p>
<p>However, Jack&rsquo;s fate was not long delayed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Infatuated with love for his paramour,&rdquo; (says
Borrow), &ldquo;he bore the blame of a crime which she had
committed, and suffered transportation to save her.&rdquo;&nbsp;
On the expiration of his lengthy term, he preferred to stay in
Australia, where he made money by teaching young gentlemen the
pugilistic art.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There are more stories of this kind showing that innocent
persons were at times sent across the water.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Well-known to the Gypsies of our Midland <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>counties is
the story of Absalom Boswell&rsquo;s transportation.&nbsp; One
night the Gypsy father and his two sons sat talking in their
tent, and, in order to rest his weary feet, the old man removed
his shoes and soon fell asleep on the straw.&nbsp; One of the
lads donned his father&rsquo;s footgear, and set off with his
brother to <i>latsher</i> a bit of <i>bokro-mas</i>, which, being
interpreted, means that they went to steal
&ldquo;mutton.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their errand was successful, but
morning light brought a policeman to the camp, for the sheep had
been missed and suspicion had fallen upon the Gypsies.&nbsp; An
early riser, Absalom had put on his shoes and was walking
abroad.&nbsp; He and his two sons were arrested.&nbsp; There were
no witnesses to the theft, but a footprint had been discovered on
a patch of clay in the farmer&rsquo;s field from which the sheep
had been taken, and Absalom&rsquo;s shoe fitted the footprint
exactly.&nbsp; On this shred of circumstantial evidence the old
man was transported for seven years, while his sons were lodged
in jail for twelve months.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On Mitcham Common I once heard the following story from one of
the Dightons.&nbsp; Seated on the wayside was a Gypsy making
pegs, with his children playing around him, and, looking up from
his work, he was surprised to see a well-dressed <i>gawji</i>
(non-Gypsy) woman staring hard at him.&nbsp; She stood there
without saying a word, until at last she moved slowly away.&nbsp;
Then came a policeman to where the peg-maker sat&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>&ldquo;You must come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know when we get to the police
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A report had been handed in that a young woman had been found
half-murdered in a green lane.&nbsp; She said a Gypsy had done
it, and described the man to a detail, giving the colour of his
hair, particulars of his dress, and the number of his
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am an innocent man,&rdquo; said the
Gypsy, &ldquo;and the Lord&rsquo;ll make her tell the truth
before she dies.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was transported for seven
years.&nbsp; Two years afterwards the lady fell ill, and
confessed that the man was innocent.&nbsp; He was liberated, but
on the homeward voyage he died.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Yet another tale from the &ldquo;tents of
Egypt&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>John Chilcot was <i>bitshado pawdel</i> (transported), and his
wife took it so much to heart that she would sit on the tent
floor cutting up straw into pieces about an inch in length.&nbsp;
At last she could endure it no longer.&nbsp; She craved for the
sight of her husband, so she <i>tshor</i>&rsquo;d <i>tshumani</i>
(stole something), and was sent away too.&nbsp; The strange part
of the story is, that the same farmer who employed Chilcot on his
farm in Van Diemen&rsquo;s Land, went and hired John&rsquo;s wife
when she was sent out there.&nbsp; The woman came to John&rsquo;s
cottage one day about sundown, and, looking through the open
door, she saw him lacing his heavy boots, as he muttered to
himself, &ldquo;I must <i>tshiv mi tshokaw opr&ecirc;</i>
an&rsquo; <i>jaw te </i><a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span><i>dik de bokr&ecirc;</i>&rdquo; (I
must put my boots on and go to see the sheep).</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;wa</i>, <i>mi mush</i>, <i>tshiv len
opr&ecirc;</i> and <i>k&egrave;r sig</i>&rdquo; (Yes, my man, put
them on and make haste).&nbsp; John looked up, and, seeing his
own wife standing there, opened his arms and she dropped into
them.&nbsp; The two worked together for months without the farmer
knowing who the woman was, then one day John told him that she
was his lawful wife, and they lived together till their time
expired, when they came back to England.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A story is told of one of the old Herons who had been
transported, and, his term having expired, he wrote to his wife
and family in England asking them to send fifty pounds.&nbsp;
This they did, and a reply was received announcing the time of
his arrival at a certain port.&nbsp; As a means of
identification, he promised, on landing, to carry a small bundle
of sticks on his right shoulder.&nbsp; His sons met him, and
according to his promise he had the sticks on his shoulder.&nbsp;
Now these sons were only tiny children when their father had been
sent away, and did not remember what his features were like, but
of course they were willing to accept him as their father, and
rejoiced accordingly.&nbsp; Then came the meeting between the old
man and his wife.&nbsp; But so completely had his features
changed during the long years of absence that she failed to
recognize him as her husband, even though he pointed to his old
bottle <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>green coat still in her possession.&nbsp; It is said
that he turned away sorrowfully, and died soon after of a broken
heart.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Moses Heron was on the Thames in a convict ship going to
Australia for <i>grai-tshor</i>in (horse-stealing).&nbsp; Some of
his relatives went out in a boat to see the last of him, as his
ship was anchored off shore.&nbsp; Moses took out his knife and
cut his <i>diklo</i> (kerchief) from his neck and threw it
overboard for them to take the knot back to his sweetheart.&nbsp;
He cut the <i>diklo</i> from under his ear so that the knot was
undisturbed but remained just as he had tied it.</p>
<p>Stories of this character might be multiplied indefinitely,
but the instances given will suffice to show how pathetic are the
annals of the Gypsies.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In a lecture delivered before the Leeds Philosophical and
Literary Society, my friend, Mr. R. A. Scott Macfie, has justly
estimated the character of the Anglo-<i>Romanitshel</i>s of
to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Great Britain the Gypsies are at present exposed to
a petty persecution, inflicted ostensibly for their good by
illogical persons, who pretend to believe that they live
unnatural lives and should be driven into town slums for the
benefit of their health and morals.&nbsp; They are harassed by
prosecutions on such curious pretexts as sleeping-out,
overcrowding (in tents every inch of which admits the free
passage of God&rsquo;s fresh air), possessing no dustbin, or
neglecting <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>to provide a proper water supply for their
habitations.&nbsp; Yet, on the whole, in this country they have
for the last century received less unpleasant attention and more
sympathy than elsewhere, and it is very noteworthy that they have
responded to this kindness by adopting the civilized conception
of their duty towards their neighbour.&nbsp; I have many hundreds
of press cuttings from British newspapers published during the
last few years.&nbsp; They prove that the Gypsies of this country
are never guilty of the greater crimes.&nbsp; The majority of the
convictions are for almost inevitable offences, such as halting
in the road or allowing horses to stray.&nbsp; Gypsies have, of
course, rather primitive views as to rights of property,
especially in respect of what grows or moves upon the earth in a
more or less wild state, yet, while there are an appreciable
number of instances of poaching, fortune-telling, and of certain
traditional Gypsy swindles, most of the cases of so-called theft
are very insignificant petty larcenies&mdash;a handful of fruit
taken from an orchard, a few swedes from a field, or a stick or
two from the hedge.&nbsp; So conspicuous is the law-abiding
character of the British Gypsies in my records, and in my
personal experience, that I do not hesitate to assert, that, in
spite of their reputation, they are as superior in honesty to the
lower classes of our native population as they are in morality
and cleanliness.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">A ROMANY MUNCHAUSEN</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Gypsies are an imaginative
folk, delighting, like children, in romances and romancing; and
if one may judge from the array of folk-tales <a

wanderers appear to possess the gift of story-telling in generous
measure.&nbsp; To this day, in Eastern Europe, the Gypsies still
pursue their ancient r&ocirc;le of tale-telling, mystifying their
hearers with stories which perhaps they brought out of India many
centuries ago.&nbsp; Here, in the West, no one can mingle
intimately with members of the Gypsy clan of Wood, amid the
mountains of Wales, without feeling the charm of the wonderful
tales handed down to them from their forelders.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have seen the beginning of a folktale in a
fragment of narrative reeled off by a Gypsy on the spur of the
moment.</p>
<p>A London Gypsy had been fiddling for my delectation, and, when
he ceased, I asked him quite casually why, being a Gypsy, his
hair was fair?&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s reflection he
replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why my hair is fair.&nbsp;
One winter night I slept <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>with my head outside the tent, and
of course my hair froze to the ground.&nbsp; When I woke in the
morning I shouted for help, and my daddy poured boiling water on
my hair to get it loose.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why my <i>bal</i> is
<i>pawni</i>&rdquo; (my hair is fair).</p>
<p>An impromptu &ldquo;lying tale&rdquo; intended to amuse.</p>
<p>Groome, in his <i>Gypsy-Folk Tales</i> (Introduction, p.
lxxxi.), notices the same sort of thing in a fanciful outburst on
the part of a Gypsy girl.&nbsp; &ldquo;She had been to a pic-nic
in a four-in-hand, with &lsquo;a lot o&rsquo; real tiptop
gentry&rsquo;; and &lsquo;<i>reia</i>&rsquo; (sir), she said to
me afterwards, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you the comicalist thing
that ever was.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d pulled up to put the brake on,
and there was a <i>puro hotchiwitchi</i> (old hedgehog) come and
looked at us through the hedge, looked at me hard.&nbsp; I could
see he&rsquo;d his eye on me.&nbsp; And home he&rsquo;d go, that
old hedgehog, to his wife, and &ldquo;Missus,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d
say, &ldquo;what d&rsquo;ye think?&nbsp; I seen a little Gypsy
gal just now in a coach and four hosses,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;<i>D&acirc;bla</i>&rdquo; she&rsquo;d say,
&ldquo;<i>sawk&ucirc;mi</i> &rsquo;as <i>v&acirc;d&ecirc;
kenaw</i>&rdquo; (Bless us, every one has carriages
now).&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Years ago I used to hear our English Gypsies speak of a
certain Happy Boz&rsquo;ll, a Gypsy given to romancing about his
own affairs.&nbsp; He was always the hero of his own stories, and
to this day, among our Gypsies, a Happy Boz&rsquo;ll tale is a
synonym for a &ldquo;crammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was once my good fortune at Lincoln Fair to come upon a
van-dwelling horse-dealer, close upon his eightieth year, whose
early days were spent in <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>the company of Happy Boz&rsquo;ll,
and from him I obtained the tales given below:&mdash;</p>
<p>Old Happy had a donkey, and one day it was lost.&nbsp; Up and
down the green lanes the Gypsy searched for the missing animal
and found it not.&nbsp; At last, as he was wandering under some
trees, he heard a familiar noise overhead.&nbsp; The sound came
from the top of a big ash tree, and sure enough, when Happy
looked up, there was the old donkey among the topmost boughs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing there?&rdquo; shouted Happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gathering a bundle of sticks for your
fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And saying this, the donkey climbed down with a bunch of nice
ash sticks.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>At one time Happy, who was a tinker and grinder by trade,
possessed a grinding-barrow made out of a whole block of silver,
and whenever he was thirsty he had only to chop off a lump of
silver and go to the nearest inn to get as much ale as he could
carry.&nbsp; In course of time his barrow grew smaller, and there
came a day when Happy had no barrow at all.&nbsp; He had
swallowed it.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>One day Happy&rsquo;s wife, Becky, said to him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and get a bucket of drinking water.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Away he went to the spring, and, having filled the bucket, he
paused to take a drink from it, and going on again he stumbled
and spilt the water.&nbsp; When he got home he appeared before
his wife with an empty bucket in his hand.</p>
<p><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you brought the water?&rdquo;
asked Becky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my blessed, I filled the bucket right enough, but
on the way back the water started a-laughing at me, and I
couldn&rsquo;t carry it no furder.&nbsp; Ay, the water laughed
itself out of the bucket, it did&mdash;every little drop of
it.&nbsp; There, now I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Another time Happy was crossing a field, and seeing a sack
filled with something he went up and examined it, and there, if
it wasn&rsquo;t full of eggs.&nbsp; He picked up the sack and
carried it away on his back, and never cracked one of them.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Happy was once walking beside a hedge, cracking nuts.&nbsp; He
had pockets and pockets full of them, and he happened to fling a
nutshell over the hedge, and it hit a wery fine hare and killed
it.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t that strange now?</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Happy never owned a wagon.&nbsp; He and his wife travelled all
their lives with a pack-donkey and a tent.&nbsp; One night their
tent took fire, and in a little while they had nothing left in
the world save the donkey and its blinkers.&nbsp; The next
morning, as they crept out from under the hedge, Happy said to
his wife, &ldquo;We shall have to beg wery hard
to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; By the evening they had done so well that
they had provided themselves with an entirely new outfit.&nbsp;
Under the hedge stood the finest tent you ever saw.&nbsp; <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>Inside it
were new blankets, new bedding, new everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my Becky, how do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t done so badly after all, my
Happy.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got a better tent and a better supper
than we had last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m thinking, my Becky,&rdquo; said Happy,
laughing softly, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s wonderful like getting
married again.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Happy was once going along a road over the Peak o&rsquo;
Derby.&nbsp; He hadn&rsquo;t gone far before he saw a cart full
of the very best china, delicate stuff all coloured and gilded,
and between the shafts stood a fine horse with silver-plated
harness.&nbsp; There they were on the wayside grass and nobody
with them.&nbsp; Happy lit his pipe and waited a bit to see if
their owner came along.&nbsp; But nobody came.&nbsp; So he led
the horse and cart to an inn just round the bend of the road, and
asked the landlord if he knew who was the owner, but he
didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; On and on went Happy, up hill and down
dale, inquiring everywhere for the owner of the horse and
pot-cart, but nowhere could he light on the gentleman, though he
nearly broke his heart with anxiety in trying his best to find
him.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Happy one day took his dog a-hunting.&nbsp; Two hares started
up, but the dog couldn&rsquo;t run after both of them at
once.&nbsp; Just then, however, the dog ran <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>against a
scythe-blade and cut itself in two.&nbsp; One half of the dog ran
after one hare and caught it.&nbsp; The other half of the dog ran
after the second hare and caught it.&nbsp; The hares were brought
to Happy&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; Then the two halves of the dog came
together again.&nbsp; And the dog died.&nbsp; Happy took off the
skin and patched his knee-breeches with it.&nbsp; Just a year
afterwards, to the very day, his breeches burst open and barked
at him.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE GYPSY OF THE HILLS&mdash;IN THE HEART
OF WALES&mdash;A WESTMORLAND HORSE-FAIR</span></h2>
<h3>I</h3>
<p><i>May</i> 12.&mdash;Just as I stepped out of the train at
Corwen, thick vapours, blotting out the mountains, made up their
minds to let down rain.&nbsp; Five years before, on landing at
the same station, it was only to find a tornado howling over the
land and heavy rain falling.&nbsp; That wild night I&rsquo;m not
likely to forget in a hurry. . . .</p>
<p>At last, after an hour&rsquo;s wait in a snug hostelry, I set
off along the Holyhead Road, having a certain encampment in my
mind&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; At the &ldquo;Goat&rdquo; Inn, where the
by-road turns off for Bettws-Gwerfil-Goch, I made inquiry for the
said camp, but the landlord only shook his head.&nbsp; One of his
daughters, however, hearing my question, said she knew where it
was, and coming with me to the door indicated the whereabouts of
the caravans of my quest.&nbsp; By now the rain had ceased, and,
in a few moments, round a bend in the highway, the outline of a
Gypsy tent, with a caravan and a tilt-cart standing near it,
caught my eye against a row of twisted oaks in a wayside <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>field.&nbsp; On entering the camp there were hearty
greetings from Gilderoy Gray and Oli Purum, his travelling
pal.&nbsp; The ruddy glow in the fire-bucket made the
tent&rsquo;s interior an inviting spot for tea, and there was
plenty of fun that evening.&nbsp; Outside: the dark night with a
roaring wind in the oak trees.&nbsp; Within: a wood-fire lit up
the red blankets stretched over the curved tent-rods, and upon a
well-made couch of straw (covered with rugs) we reclined.&nbsp;
Oli was in fine form for tale-telling, and his pipe often went
out.&nbsp; Gilderoy, too, had heaps of things to tell.&nbsp; Was
ever a lover of the road better stocked with anecdotes than
he?</p>
<p>In the tilt-cart I made my bed, and slept as soundly as a
dormouse.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 13.&mdash;At 5 a.m. the sun was shining gloriously
upon the mountains.&nbsp; Wash and breakfast in the open
air.&nbsp; In the forenoon we three took the hilly road leading
to Bettws-Gwerfil-Goch.&nbsp; A light breeze from off the
mountains carried the smell of spring everywhere.&nbsp; The birds
were all a-twitter in the leafing woods.&nbsp; Blue speedwells,
white stars of stitchwort, bee-haunted gorse bloom&mdash;all
turned to salute the sovereign sun glowing down upon the
land.&nbsp; Gilderoy, ever a good walker, was soon pegging on
ahead; then at a stile in a hedge he would wait until Oli and I
came up.&nbsp; Just below the village of Bettws-Gwerfil-Goch, we
stood on the <i>puri porj</i> (old bridge) and watched the trout
leap in the vandyke-brown pools of the river Alwen.&nbsp; On to
the &ldquo;Hand&rdquo; <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>tavern, my ideal village inn.&nbsp;
George Borrow saw the interiors of many such houses during his
tramps through &ldquo;Wild Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor are we likely
to forget the kindness we received at the home of a certain great
Scholar-Gypsy and Gypsy-Scholar, perched upon a high point
commanding a magnificent landscape.</p>

</a></p>
<p>About tea-time a jolly face appeared at our tent door,
announcing the arrival of Gil&rsquo;roy&rsquo;s brother Jim, and,
just as dusk was enfolding the scene, a merry boy came bounding
into the camp.&nbsp; This was Deborah Purum&rsquo;s Willy, who
told us that Bala Fair was to take place on the morrow.&nbsp;
Lively indeed was our camp this evening, for had not our company
increased by two?&nbsp; Resolving to set off in good time toward
Bala in the morning, we slipped into our beds about midnight, and
soon forgot to listen to the owls hooting mournfully in the
woods.</p>

</a></p>
<p><i>May</i> 14.&mdash;A white mist on the mountains foretold a
fine day, and by 6.30 we were breakfasting on trout and bacon
done over a wood fire.&nbsp; Then harnessing the mare to the
tilt-cart, we all climbed aboard, and away we rattled towards
Bala.&nbsp; The wayside woods were empurpled with hyacinths, and
on the hedge-banks little bushes of bilberry hung out their
crimson flowers.&nbsp; Oli Purum, who is half a Welsh Gypsy,
could tell us the very names of the families who had camped round
the black patches on the roadsides.&nbsp; Springing off the cart,
he would examine the heaps of willow-peelings with a critical <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>&Acirc;wa</i>, (yes) I thought so.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
some of the Klisons (Locks) that&rsquo;s been <i>hatsh</i>in
<i>akai</i> (stopping here).&rdquo;&nbsp; A splendid trotter, our
mare made light work of pulling the tilt-cart over those
seventeen miles down the vale to Bala.&nbsp; Of course we were
all wondering as to the Gypsies we might see at the fair.&nbsp;
What a crowd of farm-folk we found filling the streets on our
arrival.&nbsp; Just in front of the &ldquo;White Lion&rdquo;
hostelry, I saw a potter-woman standing before a spread of
crockery of all shapes and sizes on the side of the road, and,
curiously enough, I had once met her son, Orlando Fox, at
Bristol.</p>
<p>Little did we dream, however, of the surprise awaiting us here
in Bala.&nbsp; Elbowing our way through the dense crowd, it was
Gilderoy who was the first to exclaim, &ldquo;<i>Dik
odoi</i>&rdquo; (Look there), and turning our gaze that way,
there, sure enough, was a very dark old Gypsy with grizzled locks
and glittering black eyes.&nbsp; His garments were weathered by
long wear amid the mountains, and in him I recognized the
patriarchal Matthew (a descendant of Abraham Wood) whom I had met
some years before.</p>
<p>The Woods preserve many stories of Abraham, their earliest
known progenitor, who flourished about the beginning of the
eighteenth century.&nbsp; Entering Wales from Somerset, he
brought with him a violin, and is supposed to have been the first
to play upon one in the Principality.&nbsp; According to
tradition, &ldquo;He always rode on a blood-horse, would not
sleep in the <a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>open but in barns, wore a three-cocked hat with gold
lace, a red silk coat, a waistcoat embroidered with green leaves,
had half-crowns for buttons on his coat, sported white breeches
gaily decked with ribbons, pumps with silver buckles and spurs, a
gold watch and chain, and two gold rings.&rdquo;&nbsp; Many of
Abraham&rsquo;s descendants are excellent players on the harp,
and all, without exception, speak pure, deep, inflected Romany,
akin to the beautiful musical dialect spoken by the Gypsies of
Eastern Europe.&nbsp; Angling all summer, fiddling or harping all
winter, such is the life of the Gypsy Woods of Wales.</p>
<p>It was with joy that we rambled with Matty along the shore of
Bala Llyn, a glittering mirror in the sunshine broken only by
rings made by rising fish.&nbsp; The windless day of summerlike
quality induced our little party to loiter by the lake, and when
at length we turned to come away, there on the road stood a
Romany lass with her little brother, as merry a pair as ever wore
Gypsy togs.&nbsp; To me it was very delightful to hear their
fluent Welsh Romany.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty in persuading Matty to accompany us to
our camp at Maerdy.&nbsp; He seemed only too glad to escape into
the sweet open country after the close atmosphere of the town
streets.&nbsp; And how the mare did travel after her feed and
rest!&nbsp; On and on up the mountain road we went, startling the
horned sheep on the unfenced roadsides.&nbsp; Now and then Matty
would point out the spots where his old folks used to camp.&nbsp;
Well away from the town, we <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>took a bite of bread and cheese at a
tiny white inn backed by a strip of pine forest, from whose
shadows darted a grey sheep-dog almost wolf-like in its leanness
of figure and sharpness of nose.&nbsp; What a penetrating bark it
had too!</p>
<p>A few more miles of rough road, with here a lone farm and
there a cottage with lumps of white spar on its window-ledges,
brought us once again to the &ldquo;Cymro,&rdquo; Maerdy, where
we encountered a funny horse-breaker, reminding one of
Borrow&rsquo;s gossipy ostlers.&nbsp; Oli Purum&rsquo;s tricks
here &ldquo;took the cake,&rdquo; and to the delight of his
audience he kept up a constant stream of them.</p>
<p>To-night we felt that fate had been extraordinarily kind to
us, as by the fire we sat listening to Matty&rsquo;s weird tales
and to Oli&rsquo;s rendering of &ldquo;The Shepherd of
Snowdon&rdquo; and other Welsh airs on his violin.&nbsp; A rare
stock of tales has Matty&mdash;stories replete with enchanted
castles, green dragons, witches, ghosts, and the hero is nearly
always a clever Gypsy named Jack.&nbsp; Matty is Oli&rsquo;s
cousin, and it is charming to see how happy they are
together.</p>
<p>To me this is a holiday indeed.&nbsp; The utter absence of
conventionality, and the diversions of the Gypsy life, are as
balm to one&rsquo;s nerves.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 15.&mdash;To-day is another blue and golden
foretaste of summer.&nbsp; Along the banks of the Alwen, dodging
in and out among huge boulders, climbing fences, scrambling
through the masses of flowering gorse and broom, Gilderoy, Matty,
and I made our <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>way to Bettws-Gwerfil-Goch.&nbsp; In the old inn, a
cool retreat after the broiling sunshine in the wooded valley, we
sat awhile.&nbsp; Years ago I saw Matty and his sons dance on the
blue-stone floor of this room, just after the New Year had come
in&mdash;a time when all Welsh folk are merry with fiddle and
song.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On getting back to our camp in the early evening, all hands
set to work, some gathering sticks, others fetching water, and
soon the supper was spread inside the roomy tent.&nbsp; Tales and
talk till the late-rising moon glinted through the holes nibbled
by field-mice in the tent blankets.&nbsp; Then to dreamland.</p>

<p><i>May</i> 16.&mdash;This morning I find thin ice on a pail of
water standing in the open.&nbsp; How bracing to complete your
toilet in the cool air from the mountains.&nbsp; See with what
tenderness the sunlight colours the rocks up there by the
hillside farmstead.&nbsp; For the first time since coming into
Wales I hear the cuckoo calling in the woods.&nbsp; High up on
the slope I see a black horse dragging a hurdle with thorn boughs
weighted by stones&mdash;a primitive harrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
have a scamper down the road through the keen air of morn, before
the sun has drunk up all the dew.</p>
<p>After breakfast I go a-fishing.&nbsp; Home in the afternoon to
find some of the Gypsy Locks coming down the Holyhead Road with
their carts and ponies; a delightful party, and much
<i>rokerben</i> (conversation) followed.</p>
<p>A little later Gilderoy and I drive in the tilt-cart to Corwen
to fetch Fred o&rsquo; the Bawro Gav.&nbsp; <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>This means
more fun for us round the evening fire.&nbsp; When depressed in
days to come, I want to remember that flow of Gypsy mirth away
there under the shadow of Cader Dinmael, while the oak-groves
outside our tent whispered in the rising wind of night.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 17.&mdash;Farewell, tent and caravan and
tilt-cart.&nbsp; Farewell, old pals beside your smoking
fires.&nbsp; Farewell, sweet Wales and your beautiful
mountains.&nbsp; To-day I return to civilization.</p>
<p>Oli Purum drove me to Corwen station, and by night I am at
home again on the Wolds of Lincolnshire.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p><i>September</i> 27.&mdash;We are at Sedbergh, a little grey
town at the foot of the Yorkshire Fells.&nbsp; Stone walls,
narrow streets, old inns&mdash;all have their outlines softened
by the mellow shadows, half-golden, half-brown, stealing over the
place this afternoon.&nbsp; Looking out from a tavern window I
experience a thrill.&nbsp; There in the street stand two
vehicles, a <i>v&acirc;do</i> and a tilt-cart, with sleek horses
between their shafts.&nbsp; That tilt-cart I should know
anywhere, for under its weathered hood I have dreamt happy
dreams.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;I say, pals, we must be stirring.&nbsp; Come
along,&rdquo; exclaims Gilderoy Gray, rising from his corner on
the smooth-worn settle.&nbsp; We follow our leader into the
street, and, boarding those vehicles, we are not long in getting
clear of Sedbergh town.&nbsp; Bound for Brough Hill Horse-Fair,
our party of six never had <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>a gayer prospect.&nbsp; Here we are
on the road again&mdash;Gil&rsquo;roy, Merry Jim, Fred o&rsquo;
the Bawro Gav, Oli Purum, his son Willy, and the Gypsy&rsquo;s
Parson. . . .</p>
<p>But even the brightest of September days must wane, and soon
to right and left of us dark ridges lift themselves against the
fading light.&nbsp; Our first stage is a short one.&nbsp;
Nightfall sees us pull up at Cautley Crag, where we seek a
stopping-place in the small croft adjoining the lonely white inn
on the roadside.&nbsp; However, the gate proves too narrow to
admit our carts, so we draw upon the wayside turf, under the
shelter of a stone wall.&nbsp; Nimble as ever, Oli erects the red
blanket tent in the croft, and Willy busies himself in building a
good fire.&nbsp; When an abundance of brown bracken has been laid
down in the tent (no fresh straw is to be had), the customary
rugs are spread and we sit down to supper.&nbsp; Pipes and
chatter make the evening hours fly.&nbsp; There is so much Gypsy
news to talk over.&nbsp; At last, having placed a warning
lantern, like a pendant star, on one of the carts, we tumble into
our beds and quickly fall asleep.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 28.&mdash;A keen, clear autumn morn making
you feel how good it is to be alive.&nbsp; After pottering about
the camp, Gilderoy and I wander along the bank of the roaring
Rawthey, while Jim and Fred, lured by the shine and glamour of
the sunlit mountains, set off across the dewy moor for a closer
look at the &ldquo;Spout,&rdquo; as the waterfall up the dingle
is described on the map.&nbsp; Down by the plank-bridge I stand
and look at the fells all a-shimmer in the sun.&nbsp; <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>Far up
beyond the region of stone walls, built (says our Oli) in the
days when labourers received a wage of a penny a day, one&rsquo;s
eye follows the forms of mountain ponies, horned sheep, and a
couple of shepherds roaming with their dogs.&nbsp; Nearer, on the
river-bank, are small companies of geese preening their feathers
in the sunshine.&nbsp; I hear from our landlord that prowling
hill-foxes sometimes snap up a goose on the moor. . . .</p>
<p>Breakfast over, we were busy packing when some of the Whartons
(Oli&rsquo;s relations) passed by in their light accommodation
carts <i>en route</i> for Brough Fair, so Oli and Willy must
needs rush out to gather the latest news of the road.&nbsp; This
meant a trifling delay in our getting off, for Gypsies are
loquacious.&nbsp; However, by 9.30 we were once more &ldquo;on
travel,&rdquo; feeling blithe as larks.&nbsp; Rumble-rumble went
the wheels on the road, and all was going as merry as a marriage
bell until a single magpie flitted across our track.&nbsp;
Observing the bird of ill-omen, I quoted the old-time
ditty&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One for sorrow, two for mirth,<br />
Three for a wedding, four for a birth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only an old woman&rsquo;s tale,&rdquo;
quoth the Gypsy, flicking the horse&rsquo;s glossy back with the
ends of the reins.&nbsp; Yet, a mile or so farther on, Oli was
the first to discover that the horse had cast a shoe.&nbsp;
Handing over the reins, the lithe Gypsy went off at a trot, and
not long after he came up flaunting the lost <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>shoe, just
as the smith at Court Common was ready, tools in hand, to put it
on.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Under the lee of a wood of bronzed beeches we made a stick
fire to warm the stew-pot, while the smith replaced the shoe amid
an interested group of yokels who had popped up from goodness
knows where.</p>
<p>The wonderfully transparent atmosphere of this region appears
to possess magnifying powers, for even the poultry on the distant
knolls assume the forms of huge birds, and as for the gaunt lady
who sat &ldquo;taking the air&rdquo; on a lonesome bench half a
mile away, she would have passed right enough for the wife of
Goliath, if that celebrity ever possessed a missis.</p>
<p>In a locality like this, romance and poetry meet one at every
turn.&nbsp; A commonplace duck-pond in a grassy hollow does not,
perhaps, suggest the glamorous things of life; yet the small tarn
lying before us in the sunshine is the subject of a curious local
legend.&nbsp; Here, says tradition, you are treading upon fairy
ground, for in this dimple in front of the beech wood you have a
<i>bottomless pool</i>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>As for yon grey house amid the trees on the common&rsquo;s
upper edge, well, the man for whom it was built lived in it but a
day and died, and over the doorway somebody has inscribed the
text, &ldquo;Occupy till I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after quitting the common, Wild Boar Fell begins to mark
the skyline on our right, and now all around us lies a realm of
strewn rocks&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Crags, knolls, and mounds, confusedly
hurled,<br />
The fragments of an earlier world.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>A
stiff push up the inclines brought us at last to the high point
from whence the road dipped into the long straggling town of
Kirkby-Stephen.&nbsp; Verily the place seemed to have dropped
asleep in the September sun.&nbsp; With as little delay as
possible we held on our way until, by 5 p.m., we had made Warcop
and had pitched behind the farmhouse where we had stayed on
previous happy occasions.</p>
<p>With all hands to work, the tent was put up in record time,
and as the ruddy sundown tinged the tree boles near our camp, we
gathered round the fire for the evening meal.&nbsp; Thus closed a
superb summerlike day.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 29.&mdash;Somewhere about 7 a.m. a whiff of
tobacco smoke comes curling pleasantly round the edge of our bunk
in the tilt-cart, and I become aware that my bedmate, Fred
o&rsquo; the Bawro Gav, is dressing.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a
heavy dew this morning,&rdquo; says he, turning back the
coverings at the entrance of the cart; and in a little while I am
up and washing outside, and perceive for myself that the cobwebs
on the hedge are delicately jewelled with drops of dew.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look at the calves,&rdquo; says Fred, &ldquo;pretty
fellows, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;&nbsp; My companion has quite a
farmer&rsquo;s eye for things, and as a weather-prophet he rarely
makes a mistake.&nbsp; Overhead low clouds are rolling, or rather
masses of dove-coloured mist, with patches of blue sky showing
between, and already the mountains rising to the north are richly
bathed in sunshine.</p>
<p>During the forenoon Gilderoy, Fred, and I <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>stretch our
legs in a stroll upon the sunlit &ldquo;Hill,&rdquo; where the
Gypsies are encamped in considerable numbers for the
morrow&rsquo;s great horse-fair.&nbsp; Many familiar faces greet
us on every hand.&nbsp; Now it is Pat Lee who springs out from a
group and nearly twists off Fred&rsquo;s hand, so vigorous is the
shaking it receives, and now I am honoured by an invitation to
test the weight of Femi Coleman&rsquo;s new baby.&nbsp; From the
doorway of a gorgeous <i>v&acirc;do</i> Sophia Lovell thrusts out
her black poll and inquires after our Oli.&nbsp; In this manner,
with many variations, we make our way between the camps, and our
ramble proves enjoyable in every way.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Going back to the wagons at Warcop, we drop into an inn, and
by a bit of luck it happens that a &ldquo;character&rdquo; is
present in the person of &ldquo;Fiddling&rdquo; Billy Williams,
the wandering minstrel, who at our request takes his brown violin
from a bag on his back and plays some lively airs, and Oli and
Willy Purum, who have turned up, dance cleverly to a tune or two
on the smooth-worn, blue-stone floor.&nbsp; But Old Billy&mdash;I
cannot take my eyes off him.&nbsp; Look at his weathered coat (a
gift from Lord Lonsdale) which in the course of years has lost
its nap and shows here and there patches of a ruddy lower layer;
surely the nondescript garment suits the grizzled old wanderer to
perfection.&nbsp; Watching him closely, I observe that he has a
very passable acquaintance with the Gypsy tongue, so, edging
towards him, I drop a deep sentence into his ear.&nbsp; How he
starts!&nbsp; &ldquo;You know something,&rdquo; says he.&nbsp;
Then he goes on to tell me that as a boy <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>he
travelled with no less renowned a personage than John Roberts,
the Welsh Gypsy harpist.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s a find.&nbsp; Who
ever expected to meet a pupil of Old Janik&rsquo;s in a remote
Westmorland inn?&nbsp; Billy says that Roberts taught him how to
&ldquo;scrape music off these things,&rdquo; twanging the
fiddle-strings with a forefinger, and smiling sweetly as he does
it.&nbsp; For myself, I count this meeting with Fiddling Billy
one of the &ldquo;events&rdquo; of our trip.</p>
<p>In the evening we again rambled on the &ldquo;Hill&rdquo; to
see a memorable sight&mdash;hundreds of Gypsy fires with rings of
dark figures squatting around the blazing logs.&nbsp; A feast for
the eyes of a lover of the nomads was this array of firelit faces
set against a background of caravans, stone walls, and
mountains.</p>
<p><i>September</i> 30.&mdash;A fine morning with a cool wind
blowing from the east.&nbsp; As we sat at breakfast, a clatter of
hoofs on the road announced belated arrivals for the fair.&nbsp;
Early in the forenoon we found ourselves in the thick of the
crowd, which, to me, seemed as big as ever on Brough Hill.&nbsp;
Once upon a time this fair used to last a whole week, much more
indeed for the Gypsy element, but nowadays the last day of
September and the first day of October are the only recognized
dates.&nbsp; Droves of fell ponies took up a large space on the
fair-ground.&nbsp; A few heavy horses and a sprinkling of
&ldquo;bloods&rdquo; met the eye at times.&nbsp; For one thing we
could see our Gypsy friends busy upon their &ldquo;native
heath,&rdquo; for where is a Gypsy at home if it is not at a
horse-fair?</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>As
evening approached, an ugly bank of inky-black cloud came over
the mountains, and the wind in rude gusts began to wail,
Valkyrie-like, in the tree-tops, and to shake our wagons in a way
that reminded one of a night at sea.&nbsp; Thus the day which had
opened so gaily ended in real &ldquo;Brough weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An authority on that local phenomenon known as the
&ldquo;Helm&rdquo; wind writes: &ldquo;The field of its operation
extends from near Brough for a distance of perhaps thirty miles
down the Eden Valley towards Carlisle, and is sharply restricted
to the belt lying between the Pennines and the river; never, on
the one hand, being encountered on the actual summit of the
range, and never, on the other, crossing the water.&nbsp;
Bitterly cold, it rushes like a tornado down the slope, and works
havoc in the valley below.&nbsp; If the &ldquo;Helm&rdquo;
happens to blow during the fair, the proprietors of scores of
refreshment tents may usually bid farewell to all the canvas they
possess.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The Gypsies, to whom I have ever mentioned the
&ldquo;Helm&rdquo; wind at Brough, invariably shrug their
shoulders, as if it were an old friend, and not a very welcome
one at that.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 1.&mdash;We were all afoot in good time this
morning, six o&rsquo;clock or thereabouts, and right glad we were
to see the sun breaking through the mists over Brough Fox
Tower.&nbsp; Taking a halter apiece, Fred and I went to fetch the
horses.&nbsp; Breakfast; then we packed, and away we went.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Good-bye, old camping-place,&rdquo; we said, as the wagons
reached the <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>Musgrave ramper, for very pleasant had been our sojourn
by the spreading trees beyond the old farmhouse.&nbsp; On the way
to Kirkby-Stephen, many light carts rattled past, going south,
and, after the stiff pull out of the town, it was good to be once
more on the open road with the keen mountain air blowing on our
faces from over wide leagues of rocks and heather.</p>
<p>By early evening we had reached Cautley, where, as before, we
drew on to the strip of wayside turf, and in quick time a couple
of plump fowls were roasting in the black pot over a wood
fire.&nbsp; To watch Oli prepare and cook those fowls was an
object-lesson to be remembered.&nbsp; Bravo, Oli, our Romany
chef!</p>
<p>Realizing that this was our last evening in the wilds, we were
in no hurry to get between the blankets.&nbsp; So we stretched
out the tales, and meandered leisurely through the fields of
reminiscence, while the cloud of tobacco smoke grew denser around
us, and the stars o&rsquo; night shone more and more brightly
over Cautley&rsquo;s black crag.</p>
<p><i>October</i> 2.&mdash;Up at seven to find the sky almost
free from clouds and holding out the promise of a brilliant
wind-up.&nbsp; After breakfast we set off for Lancaster, near
whose castle we parted; and now, over fireside pipes, my notebook
and its jottings possess the power to make every sight and sound
of the journey live again.</p>

278</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FURZEMOOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Are</span> you seeking a recipe for
youth?&nbsp; Go a-Gypsying.&nbsp; Forth to the winding road under
the open sky, the Gypsies are calling you.&nbsp; Scorning our
hurrying mode of life, these folk are content to loiter beneath
the green beeches, or in the shadow of some old inn on the fringe
of a windy common.&nbsp; Like Nature herself, these wildlings of
hers overflow with the play-spirit and therefore remain ever
youthful.&nbsp; To rub shoulders with them, I have found, is to
acquire a laughing indifference to dull care and all its
melancholy train.&nbsp; Whoever then would grow light-hearted and
become just a happy child of sun and star and stream, let him
respond to the call of the road: let him go a-Gypsying.</p>
<p>Long ago I observed that during the pleasanter months of the
year a few families of wanderers were generally to be found
encamped upon a secluded waste&mdash;which I will call
Furzemoor&mdash;where, by the courtesy of the owner, they were
allowed to remain as long as they pleased.&nbsp; They resorted
thither, so it seemed to me, to recuperate from the effects of
their <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>winter&rsquo;s sojourn upon the city ash-patches hemmed
in by unsavoury gas-lit streets.</p>
<p>One April afternoon, following close upon a lengthy stay in
London, I remember how blithely I tramped along the grassy
cart-track, which, after winding between hedgerows full of green
sprays, sweet odours and tinkling bird-notes, emerged upon rugged
Furzemoor&mdash;one of those few places which in after years
become for you backgrounds of dream-like delight by reason of the
memories associated with them.&nbsp; Is it not to such spots that
the fancy turns when the mood of the commonplace hangs heavily
upon you, and any shred of adventure would be more stirring to
the heart than &ldquo;the cackle of our burg,&rdquo; which is too
often mistaken for &ldquo;the murmur of the world&rdquo;?</p>
<p>No matter how often I came, the moor had ever the power to
stir one&rsquo;s imagination anew by its suggestive atmosphere of
the remote, the aloof, the wild; and having paused at the end of
the lane to renew old recollections, I went forward and peered
over the edge of a declivity fringed with bushes of furze in
golden flower.&nbsp; Ah! there below the slope, kissed by the
warm sun and fanned by the breath of spring from off the heath,
lay the brown tents, tilt-carts, and smouldering fires of a
Romany camp, looking strangely deserted save for a girlish figure
reclining near one of the fires over which a kettle was
slung.&nbsp; Pushing between the bushes, my blundering feet
loosened some large stones which rolled <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>down the
bank with a rattle, causing the girl to look sharply over her
shoulder, and simultaneously from her red lips came a warning
whistle, a shrill penetrating note first ascending then dropping
again.&nbsp; I had heard that whistle of old and knew well its
significance.&nbsp; In response thereto a Gypsy man appeared from
behind the tents, his keen eyes gleaming with recognition.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hey, <i>rashai</i>, we&rsquo;s been a-talking about you
lately.&nbsp; Only last night I was saying, p&rsquo;raps our
pass&rsquo;n will be coming to see us one of these days, and here
you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the greeting I got from Gypsy Sam, who now wheeled
about and walked me off to a sandy hollow where his wife Lottie
and her bairns sat by the fire.&nbsp; On catching sight of me,
the children&mdash;a black-eyed troop&mdash;raised a shout of
welcome, and, like little savages, soon began tugging at my coat
tails.&nbsp; After an absence of several months from the
camping-place this was a joyful meeting, and I guessed that my
friends had much news to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p280b.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use pretending to offer you a
chair,&rdquo; said Lottie, giving my hand a hearty shake,
&ldquo;for we haven&rsquo;t got one.&nbsp; If there&rsquo;s
anything I does detest, it&rsquo;s chairs.&nbsp; The nasty things
make sich draughts about &rsquo;ur legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; So,
squatting on the ground, I awaited the unfolding of the family
budget.</p>
<p>There was a touch of the Orient on every side.&nbsp; Stuck in
the wind-rippled sand under a bold wall of rock were curved
tent-rods with brown blankets pinned round them.&nbsp; Between
the golden furze <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>clumps a lean horse and a shaggy ass ripped the
grasses.&nbsp; A greyhound lay asleep under a tilt-cart upon the
shafts of which sundry gay garments were hanging to dry.&nbsp;
Upon this picture my eye rested with pleasure.</p>
<p>Now Gypsy Sam ignites his tobacco by scooping up a red ember
with the bowl of his pipe.&nbsp; His wife does the same, and I
follow suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prettier place is this,&rdquo; quoth Lottie,
&ldquo;than when you see&rsquo;d us under that ugly railway bank
at Hull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verily the Gypsies are possessed of an &aelig;sthetic sense,
and their roving eyes grow wistful as they take in the beauty of
the distant hills and the sun-gleams lighting up grassy knolls
and spindly fir-trees rising from patches of sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember that <i>pawno grai</i> (white horse) of
ours?&rdquo; says Sam.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, we lost him a little
while back.&nbsp; A bit of <i>wafro bok</i> (bad luck) that was
for us.&nbsp; We was stopping at a place with nasty bogs around
us, and one stormy night the <i>grai</i> got into one of
&rsquo;em unbeknown to we, and i&rsquo; the morning we found him
with no more than his nose sticking out.&nbsp; Of course he were
dead as a stone.&nbsp; Then there was that <i>kawlo jukel</i>
(black dog) what you saw at Hull&mdash;brother to this one under
the cart&mdash;he got poisoned up yonder by Rotherham.&nbsp; I
reckon a keeper done it as had a spite agen us.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; parted with that dog for a good deal;
he&rsquo;s got us many a rabbit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steaming splutter of the kettle suggests a <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>meal, which
is soon spread in winsome style.&nbsp; Meanwhile, from another
fire hard by, a black pot is brought, and a savoury stew is
followed by tea and slices of buttered bread with green cresses
fresh from the brook.&nbsp; As Lottie lifts the silver teapot to
pour out tea, I cannot help admiring the lovely old thing, and
the Gypsy sees my appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; (holding it up in the sunlight),
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a beauty, ain&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; Did you ever
hear of my Aunt J&#333;ni&rsquo;s quart silver teapot?&nbsp;
Squire Shandres used to fix greedy eyes on it whenever he come
down to the camp, but my aunt wouldn&rsquo;t part with it, not
likely.&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t remember J&#333;ni, of
course.&nbsp; A funny old woman she were, to be sure.&nbsp; There
was one thing I minds her a-telling of us.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d been
out with her <i>kipsi</i> (basket) but it weren&rsquo;t one of
her good days, and by night her basket was nearly as heavy as
when she&rsquo;d set out.&nbsp; Twopence was all she&rsquo;d
made, as she passed through three or four willages, tumble-down
sort of places, where the house walls were bent and the thatches
of the cottages were sinking into the rooms underneath
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; At one of these cottages as stood in an odd
corner, J&#333;ni stopped to knock.&nbsp; Two steps led up to a
green door with a bird-cage hanging outside.&nbsp; She waited a
minute, but as nobody came she gave two more raps and tried the
door.&nbsp; It was bolted.&nbsp; After that she heard sounds
inside, a muttering voice came nearer, and slip-slap went the
shoes, as an old woman opened the door.&nbsp; Talk about ugly,
she was that, if you like; and there was hair growing on her lip
and <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>chin.&nbsp; Fixing her black eyes on J&#333;ni, she
scowled and scolded, and, pointing a finger at her, she cursed
poor J&#333;ni, and for ten days afterwards my aunt
couldn&rsquo;t speak proper.&nbsp; Whenever she tried to talk,
she could only groan and bark and moo like the beastses, and it
wasn&rsquo;t till after the tenth day that she were herself at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From witches it was not a long leap to wise men.</p>
<p>Said Lottie, &ldquo;Did I ever tell you about the wise man of
Northampton?&nbsp; Well, it was one time as I&rsquo;d had wery
bad luck indeed with my basket.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t sell
nothing at all in the willages agen that town, but I know&rsquo;d
a <i>gozvero mush</i> (wise man) as lived there, so I went to see
him, and he give me a rabbit&rsquo;s head and a cake of
bread.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;go you and call
at the places where you&rsquo;ve took nothing, and you&rsquo;ll
take money at all of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what he told me came true, every word of it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll take my sacrium oath it did.&nbsp; That there
<i>gozvero mush</i> (wise man) could tell the names of folks as
had stolen things, and he could <i>d&ucirc;ker</i> (tell
fortunes) like one of us.&nbsp; He could tell folk a lot about
theirselves by rubbing his hand over the bumps on their heads,
and he could read the stars like a book, and find out things by
the cards and by the crystal.&nbsp; He was sort of friendly with
our people, and they liked him, but they would never go near a
witch if they knew it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been truly said, &ldquo;No one is fond of <a
name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Gypsies,
but is fonder of Gypsy children.&rdquo;&nbsp; Grave-eyed pixies,
at once bold and reserved, these quaint little sprites are simply
irresistible.&nbsp; When the meal is over, I stroll off with a
party of these romping rascals towards a gorsy hollow which the
sun warms into a gayer gold.&nbsp; Asking the children if they
would like a tale, and what sort?&nbsp; Answer comes, &ldquo;A
<i>muleno gudlo</i>&rdquo; (fairy tale).</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile long, in course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Into my tale creeps a ghost, and when I had done, little
Reuben says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know something about <i>mulos</i> (ghosts).&nbsp; One
time a man was killed by a bull at the corner of the lane down
yonder, and we allus hurries past that place for fear of
<i>dik</i>in his <i>mulo</i>&rdquo; (seeing his ghost).&nbsp;
&ldquo;And then there was two Gypsies as father once
know&rsquo;d.&nbsp; They begged some straw from a farmer and put
it in a little shed for to sleep on.&nbsp; Then they went into
the willage to buy a loaf, and when they got back they found the
straw had gone.&nbsp; A little ways off they see&rsquo;d a woman
running away with the straw, but &rsquo;stid of follering her
they went straight to the farmhouse where they&rsquo;d got leave
to sleep in the shed, and they told the farmer about the woman,
and he says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, that&rsquo;s my old woman as died ten year
ago.&rsquo;&nbsp; My word, those Gypsies soon began to look out
for a sleeping-place somewhere else.&nbsp; Yes, we knows a lot
about <i>mulo</i>s.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that noise?&rdquo; asked one of the
girls, springing up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come away <i>tshav&ecirc;</i> (children).&nbsp; Come
away, sir.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you hear that nasty little
<i>sap</i>&rdquo; (snake)?</p>
<p>From among the mossy stones near at hand came a hissing sound,
and there, sure enough, was a small viper wagging his
black-forked tongue at us.&nbsp; We got up and moved nearer the
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Norfolk&rsquo;s the place for sarpints,&rdquo; said one
of the boys; &ldquo;I once see one with a frog in its
mouth.&nbsp; Lor, how the poor thing did squeal.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s lots of lizards about here, and they say that a
<i>hotshi</i> (hedgehog) will eat &rsquo;em, but if I thought
<i>that</i> I&rsquo;d never touch no more <i>hotshi</i>
s&rsquo;long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told the children of a little incident which had happened on
my way to Furzemoor, how I had cycled into a family of weasels
crossing the road but didn&rsquo;t run over any of them, and,
dismounting, I banged one of the little fellows with my
hat.&nbsp; He lay still, and I thought he was dead, but when I
turned my head for a moment he was gone like a flash.&nbsp;
Lottie, who had drawn near and was listening, remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bad luck to meet a wezzel on the <i>drom</i>
(road), but if there&rsquo;s anything we does like to meet,
it&rsquo;s the Romany <i>tshiriklo</i> (bird),&rdquo; which I
knew to be the pied wagtail, the foreteller of coming
Gypsies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we sees our <i>tshiriklo</i> on the road, and it
flies, we knows we are going to meet Gypsies who&rsquo;ll be akin
to us, but if it only runs away, the travellers coming will be
strangers.&nbsp; One day me and my man <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>was on the
<i>drom</i> and we see a young hare tumbling over and over in
front of us.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a sign as means ill, and, sure
enough, a few days after we heard tell of the death of my
man&rsquo;s uncle &rsquo;Lijah.&nbsp; Talking about meeting
things, I&rsquo;ve heard it said that if you meet two carts, one
tied behind t&rsquo;other, you&rsquo;ll soon go to
prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strains of a fiddle now proceeded from where Sam sat alone
by the fire, and we joined him.&nbsp; As the sun was going down
one of the girls proposed a dance, and soon a merry whirl of
Gypsy elves enlivened the camp.&nbsp; By the fireside,
reminiscences came crowding into Sam&rsquo;s brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many&rsquo;s the time, as you know, we&rsquo;ve
draw&rsquo;d on to this place, and I takes good care to be
friendly with all the keepers round here.&nbsp; I never meddles
wi&rsquo; nothink, you see, so we never gets across wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Ay, but I minds when I didn&rsquo;t used to be
so pertikler.&nbsp; See that oak wood up yonder?&nbsp; In my
young days me and my old mammy got leave from a keeper to gather
acorns in that wood.&nbsp; Us used to take &rsquo;ur sacks and
fill &rsquo;em with acorns and sell &rsquo;em to a man as we
know&rsquo;d.&nbsp; And mam &rsquo;ud warn me not to meddle with
the rabbits, lest we should be forbid to stop on here.&nbsp; One
afternoon mam had half-filled her sack, and when her back was
turned, I tumbled the acorns out, and slipped into the sack three
rabbits as I&rsquo;d knocked over, and I put the acorns back on
the top of &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I was a good big lad then, and, my,
wasn&rsquo;t I frit when I see the keeper coming with <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>his
dog.&nbsp; When he got up to us, he and mam got a-talking, and I
see the dog sniffing round the bag.&nbsp; The keeper, thinking
that there was only acorns in it, shouts to the dog, &ldquo;Come
away there.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the dog stuck there, and I was
trembling in my boots for fear we should get into trouble.&nbsp;
Howsiver, the keeper kept calling the dog off, and soon they goes
away.&nbsp; Then I nips up the bag and trots off home with it,
and when I told mam about it afterwards she gave me a downright
good scolding and begged me never to do it no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our old folks allus travelled with pack-donkeys, and
they had one donkey as was a wery knowing animal.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing it did.&nbsp; We was stopping in a
lane of a summer&rsquo;s evening, and our <i>foki</i> (people)
was smoking afore the fire under a hedge with the children
playing round, and everybody was as happy as the Lord in Heaven,
but all at once our <i>maila</i> (donkey) comes and pokes its
head atween daddy and me, and I taps it on the nose,
playful-like, to send it away, but it comes back, and it was that
restless and fidgety, poking and pulling at us&mdash;it
wouldn&rsquo;t be druv off.&nbsp; My mammy had been watching it
from the tent, and she come up and says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That <i>maila</i> knows summut, I
reckons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s a sign sure enough,&rsquo; says
daddy.&nbsp; And the donkey still kep&rsquo; on poking and
pulling at us.&nbsp; Long and by last dad says&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;d better clear out of here,&rsquo; for
he thought <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>there was summut queer about the donkey&rsquo;s goings
on.&nbsp; Well, we pulled up the tent rods and packed &rsquo;ur
things, and we&rsquo;d only just got out of the lane when two
horsemen come along and began inquiring about a little pig as was
missing from a farm.&nbsp; They made us unpack, and they searched
through everythink, but, of course, they couldn&rsquo;t find
nothink agen us, and they goes their way and we goes ours.&nbsp;
And that night, after we had settled down in an old quarry a bit
furder on, my daddy beckoned me and took me to a deep hollow full
o&rsquo; dead leaves, and, scrabbling among &rsquo;em, he takes
out&mdash;what do you think?&nbsp; The nicest little <i>bawlo</i>
(porker) you ever see&rsquo;d, and we gets it safe home.&nbsp;
That donkey <i>did</i> know summut after all.&nbsp; Ay, them were
the old times.&nbsp; Things is wery different now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come here to-morrow you&rsquo;ll mebbe walk up
with me to the planting on t&rsquo;other side of yon beck.&nbsp;
The <i>rai</i> as this land belongs to lets me <i>tshin</i> (cut)
all the <i>wuzen</i> (elder) I wants.&nbsp; My old daddy used to
say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You should never lay a chopper to a tree
wi&rsquo;out first axing the fairies&rsquo; leave,&rsquo; but
folks forgets to do it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of my friends here began to turn frequently in the
direction of the cart-track.&nbsp; Indeed, when their eyes were
not looking that way it seemed to me that their minds still
were.&nbsp; Nor was this expectancy to go long unsatisfied, for
soon there appeared in the sunken lane a black chimney topping <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>a
green-hooded vehicle, a light cart bringing up the rear.&nbsp;
These Gypsies turned out to be a married son of Sam, with his
wife and family.&nbsp; Here was a jolly arrival.&nbsp; With
surprising rapidity the horses were unyoked, and the newcomers
were gathered round their parents on the grass.&nbsp; Off to a
well-known spring run the girls to fill the kettle and a bucket
or two, and the boys scamper off towards a spinney to return with
an abundance of dead wood.&nbsp; Then how the fires crackle and
spurt, and in next to no time the steam is puffing from kettle
spouts.</p>
<p>Feeling ten years younger for my visit to the Furzemoor
Gypsies, I climbed up the deeply-rutted lane on the way to the
distant railway station, and, as I turned for a last look, brown
hands were waving, and <i>kushto bok</i> (good luck), which is
the Gypsy&rsquo;s &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; was shouted after
me.&nbsp; On my part I felt a strong tugging at the heart when,
at a bend in the lane, I caught a farewell glimpse of the domed
tents, upcurling blue smoke, and happy Gypsies among the golden
gorse.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
